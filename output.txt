Outstanding Issues: None  

-------------------------------------------------  
MAIN FLOW (SUCCESS SCENARIO)  
-------------------------------------------------  
1. admin requests to view user accounts → system displays the list of user accounts.  
2. admin selects a user account to manage → system presents options to edit or delete the selected account.  
3. admin updates user account information → system saves the changes and confirms the update.  
4. admin deletes a user account → system removes the account and confirms the deletion.  
5. admin creates a new user account → system adds the new account and confirms its creation.  

-------------------------------------------------  
ALTERNATIVE FLOWS  
-------------------------------------------------  
AF-1 (from Step 2): If the admin chooses to create a new user account instead of editing or deleting, the system presents a form for entering new user details.  
AF-2 (from Step 3): If the admin cancels the update, the system discards changes and returns to the user account list.  

-------------------------------------------------  
EXCEPTION FLOWS  
-------------------------------------------------  
EF-1 (from Step 3): If the update fails due to validation errors, the system displays an error message indicating the issues that need to be resolved.  
EF-2 (from Step 4): If the deletion fails due to system constraints, the system displays an error message indicating that the account cannot be deleted.
