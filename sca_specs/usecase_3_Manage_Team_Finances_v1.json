    "League financial rules and constraints, including budget limits and allowable expense categories, are configured elsewhere in the system and are available for use when managing finances.",
    "The automation of allocating match officials to games, while mentioned in the same requirement group, is treated as a supporting background function and does not change the visible steps of this financial management interaction.",
    "All monetary values are expressed in currencies and formats that the system is already configured to handle.",
    "Network connectivity and client devices (desktop or other) used by the actors are functioning correctly while executing this use case."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. team manager → The team manager selects the option in the system to manage finances for a specific team.",
    "2. System → The system displays the selected team’s current financial overview, including existing recorded transactions and budget status based on league rules.",
    "3. team manager → The team manager initiates the creation of a new financial transaction or the update of an existing financial transaction for the team.",
    "4. System → The system prompts the team manager to provide required financial details such as transaction category, amount, date, and any relevant descriptive information, and presents available options that comply with configured league rules.",
    "5. team manager → The team manager enters the requested financial details for the transaction and confirms the entry or update.",
    "6. System → The system validates the provided financial details against basic data validation and currently configured league financial rules and then records the transaction or updates the existing transaction for the team.",
    "7. System → The system recalculates and updates the team’s budget management state, including balances and any derived metrics affected by the new or updated transaction.",
    "8. ifa budget auditor → The IFA budget auditor selects the option in the system to review and audit the budget management of a chosen team.",
    "9. System → The system presents the selected team’s detailed financial information, including the list of transactions and the current budget status for audit purposes.",
    "10. ifa budget auditor → The IFA budget auditor requests a system-generated report summarizing the team’s budget management over a chosen period or scope.",
    "11. System → The system generates a structured budget management report based on the stored financial data and displays or makes the report available to the IFA budget auditor.",
    "12. System → The system persists all financial data and the current budget status so that it is available for subsequent audits and reporting."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): The IFA budget auditor performs direct financial record review without initiating new or updated transactions. Condition: The actor is an IFA budget auditor whose intent is read-only review. The IFA budget auditor selects the same team financial management option as in Step 8 instead of performing Step 3. The system proceeds directly to present the detailed financial information as described in Step 9, and the flow then continues with Step 10.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 8): The IFA budget auditor chooses to filter or limit the financial information by a specific time period or transaction type before review. Condition: The auditor wants a focused subset of data. After Step 8, the IFA budget auditor specifies filter criteria such as date range or transaction category. The system applies the filters and then presents the filtered financial information in place of the full list in Step 9, after which the use case continues with Step 10 using the filtered data."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 6): Financial details fail validation or conflict with league financial rules. Condition: The entered transaction data is incomplete, improperly formatted, or violates configured league financial constraints. The system rejects the transaction, displays appropriate validation or rule-violation messages to the team manager, and does not apply any change to the stored financial data or budget status. The use case ends for the attempted transaction, and the team manager may initiate the main flow again to correct the data.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 10): System-generated budget report cannot be produced. Condition: Required financial data is unavailable or an internal processing error occurs during report generation. The system informs the IFA budget auditor that the report cannot be generated at this time and provides an error message. No report is produced, and previously stored financial information remains unchanged. The use case ends for the reporting attempt while allowing the auditor to try again later.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 1): The actor does not have sufficient permissions to manage or review the selected team’s financial data. Condition: Access control checks fail for the requested operation. The system denies access to the financial management functions for the selected team, informs the actor of insufficient permissions, and does not display any sensitive financial information. The use case terminates without changing any financial data."
