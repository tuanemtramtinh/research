  "assumptions": [

    "It is assumed that user access restriction is implemented through existing role- or group-based access control mechanisms, and that this use case only configures mappings between user categories and tools, without defining new access control mechanisms.",
    "It is assumed that the ifa interacts with a configuration user interface provided by the IFA Central Management System, and that detailed UI design is outside the scope of this use case.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. ifa selects the system configuration function for integration settings → System displays available configuration options for integrating existing external systems and shows current integration status.",

    "3. ifa confirms the integration configuration for the selected existing external systems → System saves the confirmed integration configuration and activates it for subsequent data access to reduce redundant data storage.",
    "4. ifa navigates to the reliability configuration section of the system configuration → System displays reliability-related settings, including parameters required to support at least 50,000 concurrent users.",
    "5. ifa specifies target reliability-related parameters intended to support at least 50,000 concurrent users (such as maximum concurrent user target and related performance thresholds) → System validates the specified reliability-related parameters against predefined limits and checks them for internal consistency.",
    "6. ifa confirms the reliability-related configuration settings → System saves the confirmed reliability-related configuration settings and prepares to apply them to subsequent system operations.",
    "7. ifa navigates to the user access configuration section for tool visibility and permissions → System displays available user categories and associated tools, along with current access restrictions.",
    "8. ifa selects user categories and specifies which tools are relevant and should be accessible to each selected category → System validates the specified access restrictions, ensuring that the configuration is internally consistent with existing role and permission structures.",
    "9. ifa confirms the configured user access restrictions for the selected user categories → System saves the confirmed user access configuration and enforces it so that users only see and can access tools relevant to their category.",
    "10. ifa reviews a summary of all newly applied configuration changes → System displays a consolidated summary of integration, reliability, and access restriction settings that have been saved and confirms successful completion of the configuration process."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): ifa chooses to configure integration parameters for only a subset of available data domains of a selected existing external system instead of full integration. System validates the subset configuration, indicates that only the selected data domains will be accessed to reduce redundancy, and returns to Step 3 for confirmation.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): ifa chooses to adjust only a subset of reliability-related parameters while leaving other parameters at their existing values. System validates only the modified parameters, maintains unchanged parameters as currently configured, and then proceeds to Step 6 for confirmation.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): ifa chooses to copy user access configurations from an existing user category to another category and then make minor adjustments to tool access. System applies the copied configuration, allows adjustments, validates the resulting configuration for internal consistency, and then proceeds to Step 9 for confirmation."

  "exception_flows": [

    "EF-2 (from Step 5): The specified reliability-related parameters exceed allowed system limits or conflict with existing configuration constraints. System rejects the invalid reliability settings, explains the constraint violation, keeps previous reliability settings unchanged, and returns the ifa to Step 5 to adjust the parameters.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 8): The specified user access restrictions would result in a user category having no access to any tools or having access that conflicts with essential system operations. System rejects the inconsistent access configuration, presents details of the inconsistency, preserves the previous access settings for the affected user category, and returns the ifa to Step 8 to revise the configuration.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 3): Activation of integration configuration fails due to an internal system error. System logs the error, marks the associated integration as inactive, informs the ifa that integration activation failed, and terminates the use case with integration configuration not applied but previously active settings preserved.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 6): Application of reliability-related settings fails due to an internal system error. System logs the error, maintains previously active reliability settings, informs the ifa of the failure, and terminates the use case with prior reliability configuration still in effect.",
    "EF-6 (from Step 9): Enforcement of new user access restrictions fails due to an internal system error. System logs the error, continues to apply the previous access configuration, informs the ifa of the issue, and terminates the use case without applying the new access configuration."
