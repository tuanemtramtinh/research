  "context_of_use": "This use case enables an authenticated team to manage its own resources in the system while ensuring that interactions and displayed information support localized language and currency for participating fans and teams.",
  "scope": "IFA League Management System",
  "level": "User-goal",
  "primary_actors": [
    "team"
  ],
  "supporting_actors": [
    "fan"
  ],
  "stakeholders_and_interests": [
    "Team: Expects to manage its own resources directly in the system to make decisions related to its resources without external dependency.",
    "Fan: Expects that any resource-related information made visible to fans is presented in their local language and currency to avoid manual translation or conversion.",
    "IFA: Expects team resource management to occur within the system to maintain transparency, traceability, and alignment with league policies.",
    "System Administrator: Expects that resource management and localization features operate reliably under high concurrent usage."

  "description": "This use case describes how a team, after successful authentication, manages its own resources within the IFA League Management System, while the system presents information and interactions using appropriate local language and currency settings for the involved fan and team users.",
  "triggering_event": "The team initiates a request to manage its resources in the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA League Management System is operational and reachable by the team.",
    "The team has valid access credentials registered in the system.",
    "The team has successfully completed the authentication process.",
    "Localization settings for language and currency are configured in the system for the initiating user account or default regional settings are available."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "The team’s resource data in the system is updated to reflect the management actions performed during the use case.",
    "Any resource information intended for fans or teams is stored in a manner that can be presented in the appropriate local language and currency.",
    "All successful resource changes are persistently stored and available for subsequent retrieval and monitoring."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "The phrase \"manage our own resources\" refers to viewing and updating existing resource-related data that already resides in the system and does not imply the introduction of new resource categories or new system capabilities beyond data modification and organization.",
    "The system already includes a separate authentication use case that handles user login, credential validation, and session management, which is invoked prior to resource management as indicated by the include relationship to \"authenticate\".",
    "Localization for language and currency is assumed to be a presentation and formatting capability applied to existing data, without altering the underlying stored values or introducing additional business rules.",
    "Fans do not initiate or perform team resource management actions but may later view resource-related information that is influenced by this use case, hence their role is treated as a supporting actor.",
    "Access control policies that determine which specific team members can manage team resources are defined elsewhere and enforced by the existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.",
    "The system supports at least one default language and currency configuration so that localized presentation is always possible for team and fan users who may not have explicit settings.",
    "The requirement that the system support many concurrent users affects performance and capacity planning but does not change the functional steps of this use case."
  ],
  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow an authenticated team to manage its own resources within the system so that the team can make decisions related to its resources.",
    "The system shall require the team to be authenticated before allowing access to team resource management functions.",
    "The system shall apply the user’s local language settings when presenting team resource management user interface elements and related information.",
    "The system shall apply the user’s local currency settings when presenting any resource-related monetary values associated with team resources.",
    "The system shall persist all confirmed team resource changes so that subsequent sessions reflect the updated resource state.",
    "The system shall retrieve and use existing localization settings associated with the initiating user when the team accesses the resource management functionality."
  ],
  "priority": "High",
  "risk": "Medium",
  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The exact definition and structure of \"team resources\" (for example, financial assets, facilities, staff, or other entities) must be clarified to finalize detailed data fields and operations.",
    "Authorization rules specifying which team roles are permitted to manage which resource types must be confirmed.",
    "The fallback behavior for language and currency when a user’s preferred locale is not supported must be defined.",
    "The level of visibility of team resource information to fans, if any, and corresponding privacy or confidentiality rules must be specified."
  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. Team → The team initiates access to the system in order to manage its resources.",
    "2. Team → The team submits authentication credentials to the system as part of the included authentication process.",
    "3. System → The system validates the provided credentials and establishes an authenticated session for the team.",
    "4. Team → The team navigates to the team resource management function within the system.",
    "5. System → The system retrieves the team’s existing resource data and the initiating user’s localization preferences for language and currency.",
    "6. System → The system presents the team resource management interface, displaying the current resource data formatted using the applicable local language and currency settings.",
    "7. Team → The team reviews the current resource information and specifies the desired changes to its resources using the management interface.",
    "8. System → The system validates the requested resource changes according to existing data integrity and access control rules.",
    "9. System → The system applies the validated resource changes to the stored team resource data and updates the persistent data store.",
    "10. System → The system presents a confirmation view of the updated team resource information to the team, formatted using the applicable local language and currency settings, indicating successful completion of the management action."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 5): If explicit localization preferences are not stored for the initiating team user, the system determines default language and currency settings based on a predefined system configuration and then continues with Step 6.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 7): If the team decides to make only non-modifying actions such as reviewing resource data without submitting any changes, the team exits the resource management function, and the system maintains the existing stored resource data and ends the use case without performing Steps 8 and 9."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): If the system determines that the authentication credentials are invalid or the session cannot be established, the system denies access to the resource management function, displays an authentication error message, and terminates the use case without altering any resource data.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 8): If the requested resource changes fail validation due to data integrity or access control violations, the system rejects the changes, displays validation error messages to the team indicating which inputs are invalid, and returns control to the team at Step 7 for correction or cancellation without modifying stored resource data.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 9): If a system or persistence error occurs while applying the validated resource changes, the system logs the error, does not commit any partial changes, informs the team that the update could not be completed, and terminates the use case with the previously stored resource data remaining unchanged."
  ],
  "information_for_steps": [
    "1. Team identifier, access to system entry point.",
    "2. Team user credentials (username or identifier, authentication secret such as password or token).",
    "3. Authentication result, authenticated session identifier, team role information.",
    "4. Navigation context, selected function identifier for team resource management.",
    "5. Team resource records, user localization preferences (language code, currency code) or references to default settings.",
    "6. Localized user interface text, localized currency and number formats, displayed team resource attributes.",
    "7. Proposed resource changes entered by the team, including modified attribute values for team resources.",
    "8. Validation rules, access control rules, validation status for each proposed change.",
    "9. Updated team resource records, data store transaction details, audit or change log entries if available.",
    "10. Updated team resource data presented to the user, localized confirmation messages, localized formatting for any monetary or textual information."
