  "main_flow": [
    "1. UHOPE defines system reliability and compliance objectives for the hospital management system → The system records the configured target objectives for availability, data backup coverage, GDPR compliance support, concurrent user capacity, and national database integration.",
    "2. UHOPE configures the hospital management system to operate online 24 hours per day and 7 days per week → The system applies availability-related configurations and activates services to provide continuous online access under normal operating conditions.",
    "3. UHOPE configures the Electronic Medical Record Database for continuous data access → The system applies configuration ensuring that electronic medical record data is accessible 24 hours per day and 7 days per week under normal operating conditions.",
    "4. UHOPE configures the hospital management system to support at least 7600 concurrent employee accesses → The system allocates and validates sufficient technical capacity to handle at least 7600 concurrent authenticated employee sessions.",
    "5. UHOPE defines and activates a backup strategy covering all information in the hospital management system → The system schedules and performs backup operations so that at least one current backup exists for every piece of information in the entire system.",
    "6. UHOPE configures and enables access from the Electronic Medical Record Database to the National Database for Medical Records → The system establishes a secure and functional connection that allows the Electronic Medical Record Database to access medical records from the National Database for Medical Records as permitted.",
    "7. UHOPE configures the system to duplicate each patient’s medical file for national transfer → The system duplicates every patient’s medical file in a form suitable for transfer to the National Database for Medical Records and stores the duplicated copies according to the configuration.",
    "8. UHOPE verifies that GDPR-related configuration options are set according to organizational policies → The system enforces the configured GDPR-related controls and confirms that processing of personal and medical data is aligned with the defined configuration.",
    "9. UHOPE reviews status indicators for availability, backup operations, concurrent access capacity, GDPR configuration, and national database integration → The system presents status information showing that availability, backups, concurrent access support, compliance configuration, and national database connectivity are all in an operational state.",
    "10. UHOPE confirms completion of the reliability configuration process → The system finalizes and logs the reliability configuration as the active operational baseline for the hospital management system."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 4): If UHOPE decides to provision concurrent access capacity above 7600 employees while maintaining the minimum of 7600, UHOPE adjusts the concurrent access configuration to a higher capacity value → The system allocates resources to support the higher configured number of concurrent sessions and confirms that the configured capacity is at least 7600 → Flow returns to Step 5.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): If UHOPE restricts access to only a subset of functions of the National Database for Medical Records, UHOPE configures the Electronic Medical Record Database integration to use only the allowed functions → The system limits national database interactions to the configured subset of functions while maintaining valid access for gathering medical files of new patients → Flow continues with Step 7.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): If UHOPE updates internal GDPR policies after initial configuration, UHOPE revises the GDPR-related system configuration to match the updated policies → The system reapplies the updated GDPR-related settings and confirms that configuration is consistent with the new policies → Flow continues with Step 9."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): If the system cannot apply configurations to operate online 24 hours per day and 7 days per week due to infrastructure limitations, the system reports an availability configuration failure to UHOPE and logs the error → UHOPE may postpone completion of this use case until infrastructure is upgraded, and the use case terminates without achieving continuous system availability.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 5): If the system cannot complete backup operations for all information due to storage or process failures, the system flags backup incompleteness, records the affected data scope, and notifies UHOPE → UHOPE may suspend reliance on the backup coverage until the issue is resolved, and the use case terminates without guaranteed backups for every piece of information.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 6): If a connection to the National Database for Medical Records cannot be established or authenticated, the system indicates integration failure and logs diagnostic information → UHOPE is informed that access to the National Database for Medical Records is unavailable, and the use case terminates without functional national database integration.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 7): If duplication of patient medical files cannot be completed for some or all patients, the system identifies the affected medical files, records the failure status, and notifies UHOPE → The use case terminates without full duplication of every patient’s medical file for transfer purposes.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 8): If the system detects that required GDPR-related configuration options cannot be enforced due to system limitations, the system notifies UHOPE of the specific non-enforceable options and records the compliance risk → The use case terminates with the hospital management system not fully configured for GDPR compliance.",
    "EF-6 (from Step 9): If status indicators reveal that any of the configured objectives for availability, backups, concurrent access capacity, GDPR configuration, or national database integration are not in an operational state, the system highlights the failed objectives and provides diagnostic information → UHOPE may choose to restart the configuration process in a separate execution of this use case, and the current execution terminates without meeting all postconditions."
