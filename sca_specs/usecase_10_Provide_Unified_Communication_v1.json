  "description": "This use case describes how the IFA administrator provides and uses a single communication medium within the IFA web application to ensure that all stakeholders coordinate through one unified channel, improving communication and transparency.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA administrator decides to use the web application to communicate with stakeholders through the unified communication medium.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA web application is deployed and operational.",
    "The IFA administrator is authenticated in the IFA web application.",
    "Stakeholder accounts and roles are already established in the IFA web application.",
    "Network connectivity between the IFA administrator and the IFA web application is available."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "A single communication medium is established within the IFA web application for all stakeholders.",
    "The IFA administrator has successfully published at least one communication through the unified communication medium.",
    "Stakeholders addressed by the communication can access the communication via the unified communication medium within the IFA web application.",
    "Subsequent communications between the IFA administrator and stakeholders can be conducted via the unified communication medium."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "The IFA web application already supports authenticated access and role management for all stakeholders, even though this is not detailed in the given requirement text.",
    "The term \"single communication medium\" refers to a single communication channel or interface inside the IFA web application and does not imply additional external communication tools.",
    "The IFA administrator is responsible for initiating and managing use of the unified communication medium for all stakeholders.",
    "Stakeholders have valid access to the IFA web application to receive and view communications, although their authentication and access management are covered by other use cases.",
    "The detailed types of communication content (such as text notices or announcements) are determined by organizational policy and do not change the functional goal of using one medium.",
    "No automated decision-making or additional processing beyond sending and making messages available is implied by the requirement for a single communication medium."
  ],
  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall provide a single communication medium within the web application for use by the IFA administrator and all stakeholders.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA administrator to initiate communications through the unified communication medium.",
    "The system shall make communications issued via the unified communication medium accessible to the targeted stakeholders within the web application.",
    "The system shall route all communications initiated via the unified communication medium through the same communication interface to avoid fragmentation.",
    "The system shall ensure that the IFA administrator can select the stakeholders or stakeholder groups to be addressed when sending a communication via the unified communication medium.",
    "The system shall record that a communication has been sent via the unified communication medium so that it can be accessed by stakeholders afterwards."

  "priority": "High",
  "risk": "Medium",
  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The specific interaction style of the unified communication medium (e.g., broadcast-only, two-way messaging, or group discussions) is not defined and requires clarification from stakeholders.",
    "The policy for retention, archiving, and deletion of communications in the unified communication medium is not defined.",
    "The rules for which stakeholder categories or roles can send messages, reply, or only read within the unified communication medium are not specified.",
    "The required notification mechanisms (if any) to inform stakeholders that new communications are available in the unified communication medium are not defined.",
    "Security and privacy requirements for communications (e.g., who can see which messages) within the unified communication medium need further specification."
  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. ifa administrator initiates use of the unified communication medium by accessing the communication section in the web application → System displays the unified communication interface available to the ifa administrator.",
    "2. ifa administrator chooses to create a new communication to stakeholders → System presents a form for composing a new communication, including fields for content and stakeholder selection options.",
    "3. ifa administrator enters the communication content and selects the intended stakeholder audience using the provided options → System validates the entered communication content and stakeholder audience selection for completeness and basic format rules.",
    "4. ifa administrator confirms and submits the communication via the unified communication medium → System stores the communication and associates it with the selected stakeholders within the unified communication medium.",
    "5. ifa administrator requests that the communication be made available to the selected stakeholders → System publishes the stored communication and makes it accessible to the selected stakeholders through the unified communication interface.",
    "6. ifa administrator reviews the list of sent communications through the unified communication interface → System displays a list of communications previously sent via the unified communication medium, including the newly sent communication.",
    "7. ifa administrator ends the communication activity → System maintains the unified communication medium with all stored communications available for access by authorized stakeholders."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): ifa administrator chooses to modify the stakeholder audience before submitting the communication → System updates the selected stakeholder audience in the composition form and returns to Step 3 for the ifa administrator to confirm the modified communication and audience.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): ifa administrator decides to save the communication as a draft rather than immediately publishing it → System stores the communication as a draft within the unified communication medium and returns the ifa administrator to the communication list, after which the flow may resume at Step 2 when the draft is later edited and submitted."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): The system detects that required communication content or stakeholder audience information is missing or invalid during validation → System displays an error message indicating which fields are incorrect or incomplete, does not proceed to store or publish the communication, and returns the ifa administrator to Step 3 to correct the information.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): A system failure or loss of connectivity occurs while the ifa administrator submits the communication → System does not confirm submission, logs the failure where possible, and informs the ifa administrator that the communication was not sent; the flow is terminated and must be restarted from Step 1 once connectivity or availability is restored.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 1): The unified communication functionality is temporarily unavailable due to system maintenance or internal error → System displays a notification that the unified communication medium cannot be accessed at this time and prevents further steps in the use case; the use case ends without establishing or sending communications."
  ],
  "information_for_steps": [
    "1. Administrator session identifier, administrator role, communication interface configuration.",
    "2. Communication type, communication creation command, communication composition form template.",
    "3. Communication content, stakeholder audience selection, validation rules for mandatory fields.",
    "4. Communication identifier, submission timestamp, administrator confirmation flag.",
    "5. Stakeholder identifiers, publication timestamp, communication visibility settings.",
    "6. List of sent communications, communication metadata (timestamps, audiences, status).",
