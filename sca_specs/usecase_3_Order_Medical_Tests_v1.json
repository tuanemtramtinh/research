  "stakeholders_and_interests": [
    "Doctor: Wants to order appropriate medical tests, set their importance, and have the results available in the patient’s medical record for diagnosis and follow-up.",
    "Lab specialist: Wants to receive clear and prioritized test requests so that workload can be managed efficiently and urgent tests can be processed first.",

  "description": "This use case describes how a doctor, while accessing a patient’s medical record, orders one or more medical tests and assigns an importance level to each test so that lab specialists can view and process the requests in order of priority and the results can be associated with the patient’s medical record.",
  "triggering_event": "The doctor decides that a patient requires one or more medical tests while reviewing the patient’s medical record in the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The doctor is authenticated in the Digital Medical Record System.",
    "The doctor has access rights to the patient’s medical record in accordance with assignment and confidentiality rules.",
    "The patient’s medical record is successfully accessed in the system.",
    "The system is available and able to record new medical test orders."

  "postconditions": [
    "At least one medical test order is stored in the system and associated with the selected patient’s medical record.",
    "Each ordered medical test has an explicitly recorded importance level (for example urgent or non-urgent).",
    "The ordered medical tests are available for lab specialists to view as part of their requested medical tests list.",
    "The system maintains an auditable record of the ordered medical tests and their priorities for the patient."

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the Digital Medical Record System already supports a separate use case that allows a doctor to access a patient’s medical record, corresponding to the indicated include relationship \"access medical records\".",
    "It is assumed that only doctors who are allowed to access a patient’s medical record are permitted to order medical tests for that patient.",
    "It is assumed that the set of available medical test types is already defined and maintained within the system or an integrated catalog, and this use case only selects from those available types.",
    "It is assumed that the priority classification of medical tests is limited to urgent and non-urgent, based on the user story wording, and no additional priority levels are introduced by this use case.",
    "It is assumed that once a doctor confirms the test order, the system will make the order visible to lab specialists without requiring additional manual notification steps within this use case.",
    "It is assumed that error handling related to system unavailability, network failures, or authentication timeouts is managed by overarching system behavior and not extended in this use case beyond the stated exception flows."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow a doctor to order a medical test to be run by lab specialists for a specific patient so that the test can be reflected on the patient’s medical record.",
    "The system shall require that the doctor access the patient’s medical record as part of the test ordering process to ensure that the medical test order is associated with the correct patient.",
    "The system shall allow a doctor to specify the importance of each ordered medical test (for example urgent or non-urgent) so that lab specialists can manage their workload by priority.",
    "The system shall store the ordered medical test and its associated importance level as part of the patient’s medical record.",
    "The system shall make ordered medical tests and their importance levels available for lab specialists to view as requested tests.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Doctor selects a patient whose condition requires further investigation and chooses to access the medical record in the system → System retrieves and displays the selected patient’s medical record to the doctor.",
    "2. Doctor reviews the patient’s medical record and decides to order one or more medical tests → System provides an option to create a new medical test order associated with the currently viewed patient record.",
    "3. Doctor initiates the creation of a new medical test order for the patient → System displays an input interface for specifying medical test details for the patient.",
    "4. Doctor selects one or more medical test types to be performed for the patient → System records the selected medical test types and displays fields for specifying importance for each test.",
    "5. Doctor assigns an importance level, such as urgent or non-urgent, to each selected medical test → System records the specified importance level for each selected medical test.",
    "6. Doctor reviews the compiled list of medical tests and their importance levels for correctness and completeness → System displays a summary of the medical test order linked to the patient’s medical record.",
    "7. Doctor confirms the medical test order submission → System stores the medical test order and its importance levels, associates the order with the patient’s medical record, and makes the ordered tests available for lab specialists to view as requested medical tests."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 4): Doctor decides to adjust the initially selected medical test types before assigning importance levels. Condition: The doctor realizes that a test type is missing or incorrectly selected. The doctor modifies the selection of medical test types (adding or removing tests) using the system interface → System updates the recorded set of selected medical tests and continues by displaying fields for assigning importance levels for the updated set of tests, after which the flow proceeds with Step 5.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): Doctor chooses to assign the same importance level to all selected tests in a single action. Condition: All ordered tests are intended to share the same urgency (for example all urgent). The doctor applies a single importance level to all selected medical tests → System records the specified importance level for each selected medical test and then continues with Step 6."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): The system fails to retrieve or display the patient’s medical record due to a technical issue or insufficient access rights. The system displays an error message indicating that the medical record cannot be accessed and does not allow the doctor to proceed with ordering medical tests for that patient. The use case terminates without creating any medical test order.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): The doctor attempts to proceed without selecting any medical test type. The system displays a validation error indicating that at least one medical test must be selected and prevents progression to assigning importance levels. The doctor may correct the input and reattempt Step 4, or cancel the ordering process, in which case the use case ends without storing a medical test order.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 7): The system encounters an error while storing the medical test order or associating it with the patient’s medical record. The system notifies the doctor that the medical test order could not be saved and does not make the order available to lab specialists. The doctor may choose to retry the confirmation after the issue is resolved or exit the process, in which case the use case ends with no medical test order recorded."

  "information_for_steps": [
    "1. Patient identifier, doctor identifier, authentication token, access rights, patient medical record metadata.",
    "2. Patient medical record content, clinical observations, interface option for test ordering, session context.",
    "3. New medical test order identifier (temporary), patient identifier, doctor identifier, timestamp.",
    "4. Available medical test types list, selected medical test type identifiers, test descriptions.",
    "5. Importance levels for each selected test (for example urgent, non-urgent), mapping between test identifiers and their importance values.",
    "6. Compiled medical test order summary including patient identifier, doctor identifier, selected test identifiers, importance levels, and any entered comments if applicable.",
    "7. Persisted medical test order record, confirmed medical test order identifier, linkage between the medical test order and the patient’s medical record, status of requested tests for lab specialists’ view."
