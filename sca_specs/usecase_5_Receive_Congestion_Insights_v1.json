  "description": "This use case describes how an urban mobility planner receives congestion-related insights from the system when traffic measures are evaluated or monitored. The system notifies the planner if a measure leads to congestion and, in the same interaction, can provide suggested congestion mitigation solutions intended to inspire the planner in addressing the identified congestion.",

  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The urban mobility planner is authenticated and authorized to use the urban mobility planning system.",
    "The traffic measure or scenario to be evaluated is defined and available within the system.",
    "Relevant traffic data required for congestion analysis is available to the system.",
    "The congestion analysis engine is operational and able to process the selected measure or scenario."

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that a \"measure\" refers to any traffic management or urban mobility intervention represented as a configuration or scenario within the system, such as speed limit changes, reversible lanes, adaptive traffic lights, closures of roads, or simulated events.",
    "It is assumed that the system is capable of determining whether a given measure or scenario leads to congestion based on internal congestion detection logic and available traffic data; the details of this detection logic are outside the scope of this use case.",
    "It is assumed that the notification to the urban mobility planner is delivered within the user interface of the urban mobility planning system as an on-screen alert or message and does not require external communication channels such as email or SMS.",
    "It is assumed that suggested congestion mitigation solutions are generated by the system from preconfigured rules, models, or knowledge bases and that the suggestions are advisory in nature and do not result in automatic changes to the underlying measures.",
    "It is assumed that the urban mobility planner explicitly requests congestion insights for a specific measure or scenario instead of the system running congestion evaluations continuously and autonomously in the background.",
    "It is assumed that the referenced related use case \"report measure impacts\" is a separate use case that can optionally be extended with congestion insights, but this use case focuses only on the direct interaction where the planner receives congestion notifications and suggested solutions.",
    "It is assumed that the system time to compute congestion insights, while potentially noticeable, is acceptable to the planner for interactive use and that very long-running batch computations are not required for the core flow.",
    "It is assumed that all supporting actors such as \"Urban Traffic Data Source\" and \"Congestion Analysis Engine\" are internal or externally integrated components that operate automatically without requiring additional user interaction."

  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. Urban mobility planner selects an existing traffic measure or scenario for evaluation within the system interface and requests congestion insights for that measure or scenario → System acknowledges the request and displays the selected measure or scenario context for confirmation.",
    "2. Urban mobility planner confirms the selected measure or scenario and initiates the congestion analysis command → System validates that all required traffic data and configuration parameters for the selected measure or scenario are available and ready for analysis.",
    "3. Urban mobility planner waits while the system performs the requested analysis → System invokes the congestion analysis engine to evaluate whether the selected measure or scenario leads to congestion based on available traffic data.",
    "4. Urban mobility planner remains in the congestion insights view → System completes the congestion analysis and determines the congestion status and key characteristics for the selected measure or scenario.",
    "5. Urban mobility planner views the displayed congestion status → System presents a clear notification indicating whether the evaluated measure or scenario leads to congestion, including summarized congestion indicators where applicable.",
    "6. Urban mobility planner reviews additional details about the congestion for the evaluated measure or scenario → System displays detailed congestion information associated with the measure or scenario, such as relative severity indicators and affected network portions, in accordance with the system's configured metrics.",
    "7. Urban mobility planner requests suggested congestion mitigation solutions for the detected congestion within the same congestion insights interface → System generates, retrieves, or selects suggested congestion mitigation solutions relevant to the detected congestion pattern for the evaluated measure or scenario.",
    "8. Urban mobility planner examines the suggested congestion mitigation solutions → System presents the suggested congestion mitigation solutions together with descriptive labels sufficient to inspire the planner in addressing the identified congestion.",
    "9. Urban mobility planner optionally decides to retain the congestion insights and suggestions for future reference and concludes the session → System stores the generated congestion insight results and any associated suggested solutions so that they remain accessible for later consultation and confirms successful completion of the congestion insights request."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): Planner changes selected measure or scenario before analysis. Condition: After viewing the selected measure or scenario for confirmation, the urban mobility planner decides that a different measure or scenario should be evaluated. The planner cancels the current confirmation, selects a different measure or scenario, and re-initiates the congestion insights request. The system updates the context to the newly selected measure or scenario and returns to Step 2 for confirmation and subsequent analysis.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): No congestion detected but insights still required. Condition: The congestion analysis completes and the system determines that the evaluated measure or scenario does not lead to congestion according to configured criteria. The system displays a notification indicating that no congestion has been detected for the evaluated measure or scenario and may show baseline traffic indicators. The planner reviews the notification and may still document that the measure is acceptable from a congestion perspective. The flow then continues at Step 9 with storage and confirmation of the congestion insights without any suggested congestion mitigation solutions.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 6): Use case extends \"report measure impacts\". Condition: The urban mobility planner is concurrently preparing or updating a measure impact report using the separate \"report measure impacts\" use case and wants to include the latest congestion insights. From within the reporting context, the planner invokes the congestion insights function for the relevant measure or scenario. The system executes Steps 2 through 6 of this use case to determine and display the congestion status and details, and then returns the summarized congestion results to the reporting context. The reporting use case continues by incorporating the congestion insights into the measure impact report and then resumes its own main flow without mandating Steps 7 to 9 of this use case.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 7): Planner skips requesting suggested solutions. Condition: The urban mobility planner only needs to know whether the measure leads to congestion and does not require suggested mitigation solutions. After reviewing the congestion status and detailed information at Steps 5 and 6, the planner does not request suggested solutions. The flow proceeds directly to Step 9, where the system stores the congestion insights and confirms successful completion."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): Required data for congestion analysis is unavailable. Condition: When validating the selected measure or scenario, the system detects that mandatory traffic data or configuration parameters required for congestion analysis are missing or inaccessible. The system informs the urban mobility planner that the congestion analysis cannot be performed due to unavailable data and provides a message indicating which data categories are missing at a high level. The use case terminates without performing congestion analysis, and no congestion insights are stored for this request.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): Internal failure in congestion analysis engine. Condition: While executing the congestion analysis, the congestion analysis engine encounters an unexpected error or becomes unavailable. The system logs the error condition and informs the urban mobility planner that the congestion insights could not be generated due to an internal analysis failure. The system does not present congestion results or suggested solutions for this attempt and the use case ends after the error notification.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 7): Suggested solutions cannot be generated. Condition: After the planner requests suggested congestion mitigation solutions, the system fails to generate or retrieve applicable suggestions due to missing configuration, lack of suitable solution patterns, or internal errors limited to the suggestion component. The system informs the urban mobility planner that no suggested congestion mitigation solutions are currently available while keeping the previously displayed congestion insights intact. The flow then continues with Step 9, where the system stores the congestion insights without any associated suggestions and confirms completion."
