    "The user is successfully authenticated and has an active session in the IFA system.",

  "assumptions": [
    "User authentication is required before granting access to any non-public functionality in the IFA system.",
    "User roles and associated access privileges are defined and maintained by the IFA within the system prior to access.",
    "Device-specific capabilities (such as browsers or mobile apps) are compatible with the IFA system’s user interface.",
    "Multilingual user interface text is preconfigured in the system for all supported languages.",
    "Users are allowed to select a preferred language during access or are assigned a default language based on configuration.",
    "The reliability requirement of at least 50,000 concurrent users is handled by the system’s underlying infrastructure and is not directly controlled by the actors in this use case.",
    "Integration with different existing systems is already implemented and configured so that end users experience unified access without manually handling multiple systems.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. User (team manager, fan, match official, or ifa) initiates access to the IFA system from a desktop browser or mobile application → System establishes a network connection endpoint and presents an access interface for credential entry or session initiation.",
    "2. User enters required access credentials and, if available, selects a preferred language for the session → System submits the provided credentials to the authentication service and captures the language preference.",
    "3. Authentication service validates the user credentials and returns an authentication decision → System receives the decision and, on successful validation, establishes an authenticated user session.",
    "4. System determines the user’s role and associated access privileges based on stored configuration → System constructs a role-specific main interface that exposes only tools and functions relevant to the user’s role.",
    "5. System applies the selected or default language to all user interface elements for the session → System renders the localized user interface for the desktop or mobile device in use.",
    "6. System retrieves any required user-specific or role-specific data from integrated existing systems where configured → System presents unified, non-redundant data to the user within the role-specific interface.",
    "7. User begins interacting with the system using the provided role-specific interface on the desktop or mobile device → System maintains the active session while upholding the reliability constraint of supporting at least 50,000 concurrent users."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): User does not explicitly select a preferred language during access. Condition: The language selection option is available but the user leaves it unchanged. The system applies the default language configured for the user or, if no user-specific default exists, the system-wide default language, then continues with Step 3.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 1): User accesses the IFA system from a different type of mobile device or desktop environment than originally targeted. Condition: The device still meets minimum compatibility requirements. The system adapts the presentation layer to the detected device form factor while keeping authentication and authorization behavior unchanged, and then proceeds with Step 2."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): Network connection to the IFA system cannot be established. The system is unreachable or the connection attempt times out. The system does not present the access interface and may return a generic connectivity error message to the user via the client device. The use case ends without establishing a session.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): Authentication service rejects the user credentials as invalid. The system notifies the user that authentication has failed and offers the user the option to re-enter credentials. If the user chooses to retry, the flow returns to Step 2; otherwise, the use case ends without granting access.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 3): Authentication service is unavailable or returns an error. The system informs the user that access cannot be completed due to an authentication service issue and does not establish a session. The use case ends without granting access.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 4): The system cannot determine a valid role or associated access privileges for the authenticated user. The system informs the user that their account is not properly configured for access and terminates the session. The use case ends without presenting the main interface.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 6): Retrieval of data from integrated existing systems fails due to integration errors or unavailability. The system informs the user that some data may be temporarily unavailable, omits the unavailable integrated data from the interface, logs the incident, and continues the session using only data that is currently available."
