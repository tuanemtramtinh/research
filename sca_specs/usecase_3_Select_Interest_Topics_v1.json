    "The acceptable system response time for displaying topics and saving selections is not formally defined and requires specification.",

    "The categorization and structure of interest topics (e.g., by players, teams, leagues, matches) are not specified and require design decisions.",
    "No explicit policy is defined for how long topic preference data is retained or how it is handled in case of account deletion.",
    "It is not specified how conflicts are resolved when a fan’s interest topics overlap with globally promoted content or notifications."
  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. Fan navigates to the interest topics configuration section of the web application → System displays the fan’s current interest topic selections and the list of available interest topics.",
    "2. Fan reviews the available interest topics presented by the system → System clearly indicates which topics are currently selected and which are not selected.",
    "3. Fan selects additional interest topics and/or deselects previously chosen topics according to personal preferences → System updates the displayed selection state for each affected topic to reflect the fan’s temporary choices.",
    "4. Fan confirms the updated interest topic selections by submitting the changes → System validates the submitted selection data and verifies that it conforms to configured constraints.",
    "5. Fan waits for the system to process the confirmation → System stores the validated interest topic selections in the fan’s profile and records the time of update.",
    "6. Fan remains on or is returned to a confirmation or content view page → System confirms successful update of interest topics and starts using the stored interest topics to determine and display relevant information for the fan."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 1): If the fan accesses the interest topics configuration section for the first time and no topics are configured, the system displays an empty selection state and may highlight recommended default topics. After viewing this initial state, the flow continues at Step 2.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 3): If the fan decides to revert all temporary changes before confirmation, the fan chooses a cancel or reset action and the system restores the selection state to the last saved configuration. The flow then ends with no updates applied, and the fan’s previously stored topics remain effective.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 4): If the fan decides not to proceed with saving after reviewing the pending changes, the fan cancels the confirmation action and the system discards the unsaved changes while keeping the last stored preferences. The flow then terminates without modifying the stored interest topics."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): If the system cannot retrieve the fan’s current interest topics or the list of available topics due to a data access error, the system displays an error message indicating that interest topics cannot be loaded and does not allow modifications. The flow ends without changing any stored fan data.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): If the submitted interest topic selection violates system constraints (for example, exceeding an internally defined maximum number of topics), the system rejects the submission, displays a validation error message describing the violation, and prompts the fan to adjust the selection. The flow returns to Step 3 after the fan modifies the selection.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 5): If the system fails to store the updated interest topic selections due to a technical failure, the system informs the fan that the update could not be completed and retains the last successfully stored preferences. The flow ends with no change to the fan’s effective interest topics."

  "information_for_steps": [
