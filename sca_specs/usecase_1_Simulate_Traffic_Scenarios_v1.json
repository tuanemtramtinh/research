  "main_flow": [
    "1. Urban mobility planner initiates a new traffic scenario simulation session → System displays an interface for configuring a traffic scenario, including options for historical scenarios, crowded events, and crisis simulations.",
    "2. Urban mobility planner selects the geographic area and time period for the scenario → System records the selected area and time period and updates the scenario configuration.",

    "4. Urban mobility planner configures increased traffic at specific locations to represent crowded events → System records the selected locations and traffic increase parameters as part of the scenario configuration.",
    "5. Urban mobility planner optionally configures crisis conditions to be applied to the traffic network for the scenario → System records the selected crisis parameters and incorporates them into the scenario configuration.",
    "6. Urban mobility planner reviews the complete scenario configuration and confirms execution of the simulation → System validates the configuration and starts the traffic scenario simulation using the simulation engine.",
    "7. Urban mobility planner waits for simulation completion → System executes the simulation and computes the resulting traffic situation for the configured time period and conditions.",
    "8. Urban mobility planner views the simulation results presented by the system → System displays the simulated traffic situation corresponding to the configured scenario, enabling analysis of traffic intensity and patterns.",

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): Planner skips using a past date baseline. Condition: The urban mobility planner decides not to base the scenario on historical traffic situations. Flow: Instead of selecting past dates in Step 3, the planner proceeds directly from Step 2 to Step 4 to configure increased traffic and optionally crisis parameters. The flow then continues with Step 4 and subsequent steps.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): Scenario without crisis conditions. Condition: The urban mobility planner decides not to include crisis conditions in the scenario. Flow: The planner omits configuration of crisis parameters in Step 5 and proceeds directly from Step 4 to Step 6 to review and execute the scenario. The flow then continues with Steps 6 through 10.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 9): Scenario not saved. Condition: The urban mobility planner only wants to inspect results temporarily. Flow: In Step 9, the planner chooses not to save the scenario and its results. The system does not store a persistent scenario record and discards the unsaved configuration after the session ends. The flow then continues with Step 10."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): Historical traffic data unavailable. Condition: The system cannot retrieve historical traffic situations for the selected past dates. Flow: The system displays an error message indicating that historical data for the chosen dates are unavailable and prompts the planner to select different dates or proceed without a historical baseline. If the planner selects different dates, the flow returns to Step 3. If the planner proceeds without a baseline, the flow continues at Alternative Flow AF-1.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 6): Invalid or incomplete scenario configuration. Condition: Required scenario parameters such as area, time period, or necessary traffic adjustment inputs are missing or invalid. Flow: The system displays validation errors highlighting the missing or incorrect parameters and keeps the planner in the configuration interface. After correction by the planner, the flow returns to Step 6 for revalidation and simulation execution.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 7): Simulation engine failure. Condition: The simulation engine fails to execute the scenario due to a technical error. Flow: The system logs the error, informs the planner that the simulation could not be completed, and provides an option to retry the simulation or to return to the scenario configuration screen. If the planner retries, the flow returns to Step 7. If the planner returns to configuration, the flow returns to Step 2."
