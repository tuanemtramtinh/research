    "The fan has a valid fan account registered in the system.",

    "It is assumed that unfollowing entities is handled in a separate use case and is not part of this use case.",

    "It is assumed that both teams and players are modeled as entities which can be searched and selected within the system interface.",
    "It is assumed that the same following mechanism is applied to both teams and players, as the requirement text treats them equivalently with respect to following.",
    "It is assumed that the fan accesses the system via an authenticated interactive session (e.g., web browser or mobile app) that supports viewing and selecting entities.",
    "It is assumed that the system persists following relationships immediately so that subsequent updates can be associated with the fan without delay."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Fan initiates access to the system user interface to follow entities → System displays the entry screen with options to authenticate.",
    "2. Fan provides authentication credentials according to the included \"authenticate\" use case → System verifies the credentials using the Authentication Service and establishes an authenticated fan session.",
    "3. Fan selects the option to manage followed entities (teams and players) → System displays the fan’s current list of followed teams and players and available search/browse options.",
    "4. Fan searches for or browses available teams to follow → System retrieves and presents a list of teams that match the fan’s search or browsing criteria.",
    "5. Fan selects one or more teams from the presented list to follow and confirms the selection → System records the selected teams as followed by the authenticated fan and updates the displayed list of followed teams.",
    "6. Fan searches for or browses available players to follow → System retrieves and presents a list of players that match the fan’s search or browsing criteria.",
    "7. Fan selects one or more players from the presented list to follow and confirms the selection → System records the selected players as followed by the authenticated fan and updates the displayed list of followed players.",
    "8. Fan reviews the updated combined list of followed teams and players → System confirms successful configuration of followed entities and maintains the associations for use in future updates to the fan."

    "AF-2 (from Step 6): Fan chooses to skip following players and only follow teams. Condition: Fan is not interested in following any players at this time. Flow: Fan skips searching or browsing players and directly reviews the list of followed teams → System bypasses player selection and proceeds to Step 8 for review of followed entities (which in this case consists only of teams) → Use case then completes at Step 8.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 5): Fan modifies existing followed teams instead of only adding new ones. Condition: Fan decides to change the set of followed teams. Flow: Fan deselects one or more currently followed teams and selects additional teams before confirming → System updates the stored associations by removing deselected teams and adding newly selected teams, then updates the displayed list of followed teams → Use case then continues from Step 6.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 7): Fan modifies existing followed players instead of only adding new ones. Condition: Fan decides to change the set of followed players. Flow: Fan deselects one or more currently followed players and selects additional players before confirming → System updates the stored associations by removing deselected players and adding newly selected players, then updates the displayed list of followed players → Use case then continues from Step 8."

  "exception_flows": [

    "EF-2 (from Step 4): Entity search for teams fails. Condition: A system error occurs or no teams can be retrieved based on the search or browsing request. Flow: System displays an error message indicating that teams cannot be retrieved at this time and logs the error for operational review → System allows the fan to retry the search or return to the followed entities overview; if the fan returns without successful retrieval, the use case continues from Step 6 for potential player selection.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 6): Entity search for players fails. Condition: A system error occurs or no players can be retrieved based on the search or browsing request. Flow: System displays an error message indicating that players cannot be retrieved at this time and logs the error for operational review → System allows the fan to retry the search or return to the followed entities overview; if the fan returns without successful retrieval, the use case continues from Step 8 with the current set of followed teams only.",
    "EF-4 (from Steps 5 or 7): Persisting follow relationships fails. Condition: A storage or network error prevents recording the fan’s selected entities as followed. Flow: System notifies the fan that the changes to followed entities could not be saved, logs the error, and preserves the previously stored following configuration unchanged → System offers the fan the option to retry saving; if the fan retries and the operation succeeds, the flow resumes at Step 8; if the fan cancels, the use case terminates with the prior following configuration intact."
