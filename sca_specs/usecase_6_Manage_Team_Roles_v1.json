  "description": "This use case enables a team manager to view team members, assign or modify team roles, and adjust the associated system privileges so that responsibilities can be delegated while keeping access limited to relevant tools and data.",

    "The team manager is an authenticated user of the IFA League Management System.",
    "The team manager has been granted system privileges to manage team roles and team member privileges for their own team.",

  "assumptions": [
    "The IFA League Management System provides a user interface that allows a team manager to manage roles and privileges only for members of their own team.",
    "The system maintains a list of team members associated with each team and exposes that list to the team manager in a manageable format.",
    "The concepts of role and system privilege are already defined and implemented in the system, and this use case only configures them per team member without changing the underlying definitions.",
    "The team manager cannot create or delete user accounts through this use case and can only modify roles and privileges for existing team members.",
    "The system enforces that a team manager cannot assign privileges that exceed the maximum allowed for team-level users as configured by the IFA.",
    "Any changes to roles and privileges take effect immediately after successful confirmation by the team manager.",
    "If concurrent updates occur from other authorized interfaces, the system applies standard consistency and conflict-resolution mechanisms outside the scope of this use case.",
    "The system’s localization, multi-language support, and device access capabilities are handled by other use cases and do not alter the logic of managing team roles."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Team manager selects the option to manage team roles and privileges within the system interface → System displays the team role management screen for the team managed by the team manager.",
    "2. Team manager requests to view the current list of team members and their assigned roles and privileges → System retrieves and displays all team members associated with the manager’s team, including each member’s current role and assigned system privileges.",
    "3. Team manager selects one team member whose role and privileges need to be configured or updated → System highlights the selected team member and displays detailed information about the member’s current role and privileges.",
    "4. Team manager chooses a new role for the selected team member from the list of available roles → System updates the pending configuration to reflect the chosen role for the selected team member and displays the default privileges associated with that role.",
    "5. Team manager adjusts the system privileges for the selected team member, if permitted, to better match the responsibilities of that member → System updates the pending privilege configuration for the selected team member and validates the configuration against organization-wide access rules.",
    "6. Team manager reviews a summary of all pending role and privilege changes for the selected team member and confirms the changes → System commits the confirmed role and privilege changes to persistent storage for the selected team member and records an audit entry for the change.",
    "7. Team manager repeats Steps 3 to 6 for any additional team members whose roles and privileges must be configured → System applies and stores the confirmed role and privilege changes for each additional team member and records corresponding audit entries.",
    "8. Team manager exits the team role management function → System presents an updated view confirming that all recently applied role and privilege changes are now active for the corresponding team members."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 4): Team manager decides not to change the role but only adjust specific privileges for the selected team member. Condition: The team manager determines that the current role is appropriate but privileges need refinement. Flow: At Step 4, the team manager leaves the currently assigned role unchanged and proceeds directly to adjust privileges in Step 5. The system retains the existing role while allowing privilege adjustments and continues with Steps 5 through 8 as in the main flow.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): Team manager cancels changes before confirmation. Condition: After reviewing the summary of pending changes, the team manager decides not to apply any modifications. Flow: At Step 6, instead of confirming, the team manager selects a cancel option. The system discards all pending role and privilege changes for the selected team member, does not alter stored data, and returns the team manager to the detailed view for that member, from which the manager may restart configuration from Step 3 or exit via Step 8.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): Team manager completes configuration for only a subset of team members. Condition: The team manager intends to update roles and privileges for only some team members at this time. Flow: During Step 7, after updating one or more team members, the team manager chooses to stop without iterating over the remaining team members. The system keeps all confirmed changes for already processed team members and proceeds directly to Step 8."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): System unavailable or team manager not authenticated. Condition: The system detects that the session is invalid or the team manager is not authenticated or the service is temporarily unavailable. Flow: At Step 1, when the team manager attempts to access the team role management function, the system denies access, displays an error message indicating the reason (e.g., authentication required or service unavailable), and does not proceed to subsequent steps. The use case terminates without any role or privilege changes.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 2): Team members cannot be retrieved. Condition: A data access error or communication failure prevents the system from retrieving the list of team members. Flow: At Step 2, the system fails to obtain the team member list and informs the team manager that the information is temporarily unavailable. The system does not allow further role or privilege operations in this session and offers the team manager the option to return to the previous menu. The use case ends without changes.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 5): Requested role or privilege configuration violates access rules. Condition: The team manager’s requested privileges exceed the permitted limits for the role or for the team manager’s own authorization. Flow: At Step 5, the system rejects the invalid configuration, displays a validation message indicating that the requested role or privilege assignment is not permitted, and maintains the previously stored configuration. The system allows the team manager to adjust the requested role or privileges and retry Step 5 or to cancel the modification and return to the view of current assignments.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 6): Commit failure when saving changes. Condition: A persistence or system error occurs while the system attempts to store the confirmed role and privilege changes. Flow: At Step 6, the system detects the failure, does not partially apply the changes, and presents an error message informing the team manager that the update could not be completed. The system keeps the prior role and privilege configuration intact, logs the failure for technical review, and returns the team manager to the detailed view for the selected member, from which the manager may attempt the operation again or exit the use case."
