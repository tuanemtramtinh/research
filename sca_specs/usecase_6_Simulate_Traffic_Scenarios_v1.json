    "4. Urban mobility planner confirms the configured scenario and initiates the simulation run → System submits the scenario configuration to the Simulation Engine for execution.",
    "5. Urban mobility planner waits for the simulation to complete → System executes the simulation using the Simulation Engine and tracks the simulation run status until completion.",

    "AF-2 (from Step 2): Urban mobility planner selects a crowded-event traffic scenario type → System prompts the planner to specify locations where traffic should be increased and the magnitude and duration of increased traffic; after the planner configures the increased traffic parameters and confirms, the flow continues at Step 3 with the crowded-event scenario configuration.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 2): Urban mobility planner selects a crisis traffic scenario type → System prompts the planner to specify the crisis time frame, affected area, and type of traffic disruption to be simulated; after the planner provides the crisis-related configuration and confirms, the flow continues at Step 3 with the crisis scenario configuration.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 6): Urban mobility planner chooses to compare the current simulation results with results of a previously run scenario using existing stored scenarios → System retrieves the selected previous scenario results from storage and presents both scenarios in a way that allows comparative review, after which the flow continues at Step 7 where the planner reviews the scenarios."

    "EF-1 (from Step 3): Scenario configuration parameter validation fails (e.g., missing mandatory fields or logically inconsistent time ranges) → System displays validation error messages indicating which parameters are invalid or incomplete and requests correction; the urban mobility planner may update the configuration, after which the flow returns to Step 3 for revalidation.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 5): Simulation Engine fails to execute the scenario due to a system error or insufficient data → System logs the failure, notifies the urban mobility planner that the simulation could not be completed, and indicates the reason if available; the flow ends without generating simulation results for this run.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 6): Retrieval of simulation results fails due to data access or storage error → System logs the error and informs the urban mobility planner that the simulation results are temporarily unavailable; the flow ends, and the planner may later attempt to access the results again once the issue is resolved."
