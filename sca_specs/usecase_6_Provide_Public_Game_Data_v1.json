  "triggering_event": "The IFA administrator decides to enable free public access to game, team, and league data in the web application.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA administrator is authenticated in the IFA Web Application with permissions to manage data access settings.",
    "Game, team, and league data are already stored or integrated in the IFA Web Application.",
    "The web application is operational and reachable by public visitors."

  "postconditions": [
    "The system is configured so that game, team, and league data are accessible to public web application visitors without additional access restrictions.",
    "The configured public access settings are stored persistently by the system.",
    "Public visitors can successfully retrieve game, team, and league data via the web application without requiring an account."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that \"free access\" means access without authentication or payment, while still allowing the IFA administrator to control which data categories are exposed.",
    "It is assumed that only data explicitly classified as public game, team, and league data are exposed and no confidential or budgeting data are included in this configuration.",
    "It is assumed that the underlying data for games, teams, and leagues already exists in the system or is available via integrated sources prior to enabling public access.",
    "It is assumed that the IFA administrator has a dedicated configuration interface within the web application to manage access settings, even though the detailed layout of that interface is not defined in the requirements.",
    "It is assumed that performance and scalability constraints, such as hosting up to 50,000 concurrent users, are handled by the system infrastructure and do not change the interaction steps of this use case.",
    "It is assumed that enabling public access does not override other separate restrictions for sensitive domains such as budgeting, which remain restricted to authorized stakeholders.",
    "It is assumed that language selection and personalization features used by fans and other visitors do not alter the access rights configured in this use case but only affect presentation."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow the IFA administrator to enable free access to all non-confidential data regarding games, teams, and leagues to improve system transparency.",
    "The system shall provide the IFA administrator with a means to select or confirm that game data is publicly accessible to web application visitors.",
    "The system shall provide the IFA administrator with a means to select or confirm that team data is publicly accessible to web application visitors.",
    "The system shall provide the IFA administrator with a means to select or confirm that league data is publicly accessible to web application visitors.",
    "The system shall persist the public access configuration for game, team, and league data so that it remains effective across sessions and system restarts.",
    "The system shall allow public web application visitors to access configured public game, team, and league data without requiring user registration or login.",
    "The system shall apply the configured public access settings consistently to all relevant views and interfaces that expose game, team, and league data."

  "risk": "Medium",
  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The exact scope of \"all data regarding games, teams, and leagues\" (e.g., whether it includes historical statistics, live data, or derived analytics) needs to be formally defined.",
    "Policies governing which specific data fields are considered public versus confidential for teams and leagues require clarification.",
    "It is unclear whether rate limiting or other traffic controls should be applied to public data access to protect system performance.",
    "The required audit or logging level for configuration changes to public access settings has not been specified.",
    "The behavior of the system when public access is temporarily disabled (e.g., maintenance windows) needs to be defined."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. IFA administrator initiates management of public data access settings in the web application → System displays the configuration interface for game, team, and league data access.",
    "2. IFA administrator reviews the current access configuration for game, team, and league data → System presents the existing access settings and their current public or restricted status.",
    "3. IFA administrator selects the option to enable free public access for game data → System marks game data as publicly accessible and shows the updated game data access state.",
    "4. IFA administrator selects the option to enable free public access for team data → System marks team data as publicly accessible and shows the updated team data access state.",
    "5. IFA administrator selects the option to enable free public access for league data → System marks league data as publicly accessible and shows the updated league data access state.",
    "6. IFA administrator confirms and saves the public access configuration for game, team, and league data → System validates the configuration and persists the updated public access settings.",
    "7. IFA administrator requests verification of public accessibility for game, team, and league data → System exposes the configured public endpoints or views and confirms that game, team, and league data are retrievable without authentication.",
    "8. IFA administrator completes the configuration session → System finalizes the session and continues to serve game, team, and league data publicly according to the saved configuration."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): IFA administrator decides to partially enable public access for game data only. Condition: The IFA administrator wants to expose game data but keep team or league data restricted. The administrator enables free public access for game data in Step 3 and skips Steps 4 and 5. The flow then proceeds directly from Step 3 to Step 6 to save the configuration. The use case completes successfully with only game data publicly accessible.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): IFA administrator decides to enable public access for game and team data but not league data. Condition: The IFA administrator wants to restrict league data while exposing game and team data. The administrator completes Steps 3 and 4, skips Step 5, and then proceeds to Step 6 to save the configuration. The use case completes successfully with game and team data publicly accessible and league data remaining restricted.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 2): IFA administrator confirms that public access is already fully enabled. Condition: The configuration already indicates that game, team, and league data are publicly accessible. After reviewing the settings in Step 2, the administrator does not change any options and directly performs Step 6 to reconfirm and persist the existing configuration. The flow then continues with Steps 7 and 8 and ends successfully."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 6): Configuration persistence failure. Condition: A system error occurs while saving the updated public access settings. The system informs the IFA administrator that the configuration could not be saved and retains the previous access settings without applying changes. The use case terminates without updating public access, and the administrator may retry the use case later.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 7): Public access verification fails. Condition: After attempting to verify public accessibility, the system detects that game, team, or league data cannot be retrieved without authentication due to an internal configuration or connectivity issue. The system presents an error message describing that public access is not correctly applied and maintains the last persisted configuration state. The use case ends with public access not fully operational, and the IFA administrator may initiate corrective actions outside this use case.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 1): Authorization failure. Condition: The user attempting to manage public data access is not recognized as an IFA administrator or lacks sufficient privileges. The system denies access to the configuration interface and displays an authorization error. The use case terminates without modifying any access settings."
