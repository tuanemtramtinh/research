    "UMD employee: Wants uninterrupted, intuitive, and remote access to the simulation platform so that work can be performed efficiently without expert assistance.",

  "description": "This use case describes how a UMD employee starts, accesses, and operates the Wonderland traffic simulation platform via an intuitive user interface, at any time, including remotely, and without requiring expert assistance, while the platform meets the expected startup time and availability characteristics.",
  "triggering_event": "A UMD employee decides to use the simulation platform to perform work-related tasks.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The Wonderland Traffic Simulation Platform is deployed in the operational environment.",
    "The UMD employee has valid access rights to use the simulation platform.",
    "Necessary IT infrastructure and network services are operational.",
    "The UMD employee has access to a device capable of connecting to the simulation platform locally or remotely."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "The UMD employee has an active session on the simulation platform.",
    "The simulation platform user interface is available and responsive to the UMD employee.",
    "The UMD employee is able to navigate and operate platform functions without relying on expert assistance.",
    "The system remains available for continued or later use by the UMD employee."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "User authentication and authorization mechanisms already exist in the system and are not designed within this use case; this use case assumes a successful login process when required.",
    "Network connectivity between the UMD employee’s device and the simulation platform is sufficient to support remote access.",
    "The platform’s underlying infrastructure is designed to support 24/7 availability and to allow startup within 2 minutes under normal operating conditions.",
    "The intuitive nature of the user interface is achieved through established usability design practices and does not introduce additional functional features beyond those implied by the requirements.",
    "Use of new data sources, as mentioned in the requirements, is considered part of the broader platform capabilities and this use case only ensures the employee can access and operate the platform that exposes those capabilities.",
    "Remote use of the system implies secure access methods are in place, but the specific security mechanisms are outside the scope of this use case."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall provide an intuitive user interface so that a UMD employee can quickly understand and use all available functions without expert assistance.",
    "The system shall be accessible to a UMD employee on a 24/7 basis to support flexible working shifts.",
    "The system shall be capable of being started up and made ready for use by a UMD employee within 2 minutes under normal operating conditions.",
    "The system shall support remote access for UMD employees so that they can use the platform from locations other than the central workplace.",
    "The system shall allow a UMD employee to operate the platform independently without requiring assistance from an expert.",
    "The system shall allow a UMD employee to access and use new data sources as they become available, provided these are already integrated into the platform environment."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. UMD employee initiates access to the simulation platform (locally or remotely) using a supported device → System presents the initial access interface required to reach the platform.",
    "2. UMD employee provides any required access credentials or follows the organizational access procedure → System verifies the provided access information and establishes an authenticated session for the UMD employee.",
    "3. UMD employee starts the simulation platform application or service → System initializes the simulation platform and completes startup within the defined startup time under normal operating conditions.",
    "4. UMD employee requests the main workspace of the simulation platform → System displays the main workspace with an intuitive, clearly structured user interface and available primary functions.",
    "5. UMD employee navigates through menus, controls, and views to locate desired platform functions → System responds to navigation actions by updating the interface in a consistent and predictable manner without requiring expert guidance.",
    "6. UMD employee operates selected platform functions (such as viewing simulations or interacting with available data) using the provided intuitive controls → System executes the requested functions and updates the interface in real time or near real time according to its capabilities.",
    "7. UMD employee continues to work on the platform for an extended period, possibly across different times of day or shifts → System maintains availability and responsiveness during the employee’s session in alignment with the 24/7 access expectation.",
    "8. UMD employee ends the work session by closing the platform interface or logging out → System closes the session, performs any necessary cleanup, and remains available for future access."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 1): UMD employee accesses the platform remotely from a home or off-site location. Condition: The employee is not on the organizational premises. The employee connects through the approved remote access method to reach the initial access interface. The flow then continues with Step 2 of the main flow.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 3): Simulation platform is already running when the UMD employee attempts to start it. Condition: The platform has been started previously and is still active. The system recognizes that the platform service is already running, skips the initialization phase, and directly presents or prepares the main workspace. The flow continues with Step 4 of the main flow.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): UMD employee accesses the system at a different time within the same day or on another day to continue work. Condition: The employee requires flexible shift work. The employee repeats Steps 1 through 4 to re-establish a session and then continues with Step 6 as needed."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): Access to the platform cannot be initiated because the network connection is unavailable. The system is not reachable. The system is unable to present the initial access interface and may display a generic connectivity failure message through the device or browser. The use case ends without an active session; the UMD employee may attempt the main flow again once connectivity is restored.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 2): Provided access credentials are invalid or access rights are insufficient. The system rejects the authentication attempt and displays an error notification indicating that access could not be granted. The system does not establish a session and returns the UMD employee to the initial access interface, allowing the employee to retry or terminate the attempt; the use case ends without successful access if correct credentials are not provided.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 3): The system fails to complete startup within the expected 2-minute period under normal conditions. The system reports that startup is delayed or has failed and does not present the main workspace. The use case ends without the employee being able to operate the platform; the employee may retry the main flow after the issue is resolved.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 7): During an active session, the platform becomes temporarily unavailable due to an unexpected failure. The system stops responding or displays an unavailability message and terminates the current session. The use case ends abnormally; the UMD employee may restart the use case from Step 1 when the platform is restored."
