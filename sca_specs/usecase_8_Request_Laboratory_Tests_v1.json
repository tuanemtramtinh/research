  "stakeholders_and_interests": [
    "Doctor: Wants to request appropriate laboratory tests efficiently and share only the necessary patient data to obtain accurate and timely results.",
    "Patient: Wants laboratory tests to be requested accurately and their medical data shared only with appropriate laboratories to protect privacy.",
    "Internal laboratory: Wants to receive complete and accurate test requests and patient data to perform tests correctly.",

  "description": "This use case describes how a doctor requests laboratory tests for a patient and shares the necessary patient data with selected internal or external laboratories via the healthcare information system.",
  "triggering_event": "The doctor decides that a patient requires one or more laboratory tests during or in preparation for a consultation.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The doctor is authenticated in the Healthcare Information System.",
    "The doctor has the necessary access rights to request laboratory tests for the patient.",
    "The patient has an existing medical record in the Healthcare Information System.",
    "Connectivity between the Healthcare Information System and configured internal and external laboratories is operational."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "A laboratory test request is recorded in the patient’s medical record.",
    "The requested laboratory tests are registered in the Healthcare Information System with status indicating that they have been requested.",
    "Selected internal and/or external laboratories have received the laboratory test request and associated patient data required to perform the tests."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the doctor is already logged into the Healthcare Information System before initiating the request for laboratory tests, because the requirement text mentions the doctor logging in quickly but does not explicitly link it to this use case.",
    "It is assumed that the patient whose tests are being requested is already identified and selected in the system prior to starting this use case, because the requirement text implies existing patient medical records but does not describe patient selection steps here.",
    "It is assumed that the system already holds any necessary patient consent or legal basis for sharing the patient’s medical data with laboratories, because the requirement text requires sharing patient data but does not specify consent management behavior.",
    "It is assumed that the list of available internal and external laboratories is already maintained by the Healthcare Information System, because the requirement text refers to sharing data with internal and external laboratories but does not define how laboratories are registered.",
    "It is assumed that the set of available laboratory test types is predefined and managed outside this use case, because the requirement text mentions requesting laboratory tests but not creating or maintaining their definitions.",
    "It is assumed that communication with external laboratories is performed through established and secure channels provided by the Healthcare Information System, because the requirement text emphasizes sharing patient data but does not define communication protocols."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow a doctor to request one or more laboratory tests for a selected patient.",
    "The system shall allow a doctor to select whether each laboratory test request is to be processed by an internal laboratory or an external laboratory.",
    "The system shall share the necessary patient data with the selected internal laboratories when the doctor submits laboratory test requests.",
    "The system shall share the necessary patient data with the selected external laboratories when the doctor submits laboratory test requests.",
    "The system shall store each submitted laboratory test request in the patient’s medical record.",

  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The specific patient data elements that are considered necessary to share with laboratories are not defined and must be clarified.",
    "The selection criteria and business rules for choosing between internal and external laboratories are not defined and must be specified.",
    "The required security and privacy policies for sharing patient data with external laboratories, including data minimization and encryption requirements, must be clarified.",

  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. Doctor selects the patient in the Healthcare Information System and chooses to request new laboratory tests → System displays the patient’s identification information and opens the laboratory test request interface for the selected patient.",
    "2. Doctor specifies the required laboratory tests for the patient (e.g., selecting test types from the available list) → System records the selected laboratory tests for the current request and displays them in a pending request list.",
    "3. Doctor selects whether each requested laboratory test will be handled by an internal laboratory or an external laboratory and, if applicable, chooses a specific laboratory from the available options → System associates each requested test with the chosen internal or external laboratory and displays the associations for confirmation.",
    "4. Doctor reviews the summary of requested tests and associated laboratories and confirms submission of the laboratory test request → System validates the request data and prepares the information to be sent to the selected laboratories.",
    "5. Doctor submits the laboratory test request → System submits the laboratory test request details and necessary patient data to each selected internal and external laboratory and records the requests in the patient’s medical record with status indicating that they have been requested.",
    "6. Doctor receives confirmation that the laboratory test request has been successfully submitted → System displays a confirmation message, including a summary of the requested tests, their destination laboratories, and recorded request identifiers."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): Doctor modifies selected tests before confirmation. Condition: While specifying the required laboratory tests, the doctor decides to change or remove some of the initially selected tests. Steps: The doctor updates the list of requested tests by adding or removing test selections → The system updates the pending request list accordingly. The flow then continues at Step 3.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 3): Single laboratory for all tests. Condition: The doctor chooses to send all requested tests to the same laboratory. Steps: The doctor selects one internal or external laboratory for all tests → The system applies the same laboratory selection to all requested tests and displays the common laboratory assignment. The flow then continues at Step 4.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 4): Doctor cancels before submission. Condition: After reviewing the summary, the doctor decides not to submit the laboratory test request. Steps: The doctor cancels the laboratory test request operation → The system discards the unsent laboratory test request data for this operation and returns the doctor to the previous patient overview screen without creating new requests. The use case ends without creating any laboratory test requests."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): Selected laboratory is temporarily unavailable. Condition: When the doctor selects a laboratory, the Healthcare Information System detects that communication with the chosen laboratory is unavailable. Steps: The system notifies the doctor that the selected laboratory is unavailable and removes the association for the affected tests → The doctor may select a different available laboratory for those tests or choose to cancel the request. If a different laboratory is selected, the flow continues at Step 3; if the doctor cancels, the use case ends without submission.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 5): Submission to laboratory fails. Condition: During submission of laboratory test requests, the system fails to deliver the request to one or more selected laboratories. Steps: The system stops submission for the affected laboratories, logs the failure, and informs the doctor which laboratories did not receive the request → The system allows the doctor to retry submission to the failed laboratories or to cancel submission for them. If the doctor retries, the system attempts submission again and, upon success, continues at Step 6; if the doctor cancels, the use case ends with requests only for the successfully submitted laboratories.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 1): No active patient selected. Condition: The doctor attempts to initiate a laboratory test request without an active patient context. Steps: The system displays an error message indicating that a patient must be selected before requesting laboratory tests and does not proceed with the request interface → The doctor selects a patient, after which the flow restarts at Step 1."
