  "main_flow": [
    "1. UMD employee initiates access to the simulation platform → System authenticates the UMD employee and establishes an authorized analysis session in accordance with the included 'access simulation platform' use case.",
    "2. UMD employee requests access to historical traffic and environmental data for analysis → System invokes the included 'manage traffic data' functionality to retrieve available historical traffic and environmental data and presents an overview of accessible datasets and time ranges.",
    "3. UMD employee selects one or more time periods and, if supported by configuration, relevant geographic areas or scenarios for analysis → System records the selected time periods and any associated spatial or scenario filters and loads the corresponding traffic and environmental data into the analysis workspace.",
    "4. UMD employee requests comparative analysis of historical traffic data for the selected periods or scenarios → System processes the underlying data and displays comparative views of historical traffic data, including indicators such as congestion or flow levels, for the chosen periods or scenarios.",
    "5. UMD employee configures and executes repeatable analysis parameters for similar situations, such as reusing or saving the current analysis configuration → System applies the repeatable analysis configuration to the selected similar situations and presents consistent analysis results, enabling accelerated workflow.",
    "6. UMD employee requests side-by-side comparison of data from two different selected times or scenarios → System displays the data from the two selected times or scenarios next to each other, clearly distinguishing them to facilitate direct comparison.",
    "7. UMD employee selects historical situations and associated solution scenarios to compare the results of different implemented solutions → System processes and displays comparative results, showing differences in traffic and environmental outcomes between the selected solution scenarios.",
    "8. UMD employee configures prediction parameters based on selected historical data, situations, or planned changes (including possible urban planning modifications) → System validates the configuration, prepares the input for the prediction simulator, and confirms the prediction setup to the UMD employee.",
    "9. UMD employee initiates the prediction run for future traffic situations and potential urban planning change scenarios → System executes the prediction simulator, generates predicted traffic conditions and associated environmental levels for the configured scenarios, and presents the prediction results.",
    "10. UMD employee requests information about the credibility of the prediction simulator for the executed prediction results → System calculates or retrieves credibility indicators associated with the prediction results and displays them together with appropriate explanatory information.",
    "11. UMD employee requests comparison between predicted environmental levels and actual measured environmental levels for corresponding locations and timeframes where available → System aligns the predicted environmental levels with the actual measured sensor data and presents a comparison view showing similarities and deviations.",

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): UMD employee adjusts selected time periods or geographic areas after reviewing initial data availability. Condition: The employee decides that the initially selected periods or areas are not suitable. The system allows the employee to modify the selections, reloads the corresponding data into the analysis workspace, and then the flow continues with Step 4.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): UMD employee applies a previously saved repeatable analysis configuration without redefining parameters. Condition: An earlier analysis configuration exists and is appropriate for the current situation. The system loads the stored configuration, applies it directly to the selected data, presents the results, and then the flow continues with Step 6.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): UMD employee focuses prediction only on future traffic situations without including urban planning changes. Condition: The employee does not wish to evaluate alternative planning scenarios. The system configures prediction parameters solely based on historical patterns and current network configuration, confirms the prediction setup, and then the flow continues with Step 9.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 8): UMD employee focuses prediction only on the consequences of urban planning changes without generating baseline future traffic predictions. Condition: The employee is analyzing hypothetical planning options only. The system configures prediction parameters for the modified planning scenarios using existing models, confirms the prediction setup, and then the flow continues with Step 9."

    "EF-2 (from Step 2): Required historical data are unavailable or incomplete for the requested scope. Condition: The system cannot retrieve sufficient traffic or environmental data for the requested analysis range. The system informs the UMD employee that data for some or all of the requested periods or areas are unavailable or incomplete, provides details on the missing data, and allows the employee to return to Step 3 to adjust selections or to terminate the use case.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 9): Prediction processing fails. Condition: The prediction simulator encounters an error or cannot complete the computation. The system notifies the UMD employee of the failure, logs diagnostic information for support, and allows the employee to either revise prediction parameters and return to Step 8 or terminate the prediction part of the use case.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 11): Comparison between predicted and actual environmental levels cannot be fully performed. Condition: Corresponding actual sensor measurements are missing for some predicted locations or times. The system indicates which parts of the comparison lack actual data, displays available partial comparisons, and allows the employee to continue reviewing partial results or adjust the comparison scope and repeat Step 11."
