  "main_flow": [
    "1. System administrator accesses the hospital management system administrative interface → System displays the administrative dashboard with configuration options, including data storage and integration settings.",
    "2. System administrator selects the data storage configuration option to configure central database usage → System displays current data storage settings and fields for central database connection parameters.",
    "3. System administrator enters or updates central database connection parameters and specifies that all system data shall be stored in the central database → System validates the entered central database configuration parameters for format and completeness.",
    "4. System administrator submits the central database configuration → System attempts to connect to the specified central database using the provided parameters.",
    "5. System successfully establishes a connection to the specified central database → System enables central database storage and updates internal configuration so that all system data is stored in the central database.",
    "6. System administrator selects the electronic medical record integration configuration option → System displays electronic medical record integration settings, including options for enabling integration and specifying connection or source parameters.",
    "7. System administrator enables electronic medical record integration and provides the required connection or source parameters → System validates the provided electronic medical record integration parameters for format and completeness.",
    "8. System administrator submits the electronic medical record integration configuration → System attempts to establish a connection or data link with the electronic medical record system using the provided parameters.",
    "9. System successfully establishes the electronic medical record integration connection or data link → System activates electronic medical record integration so that patient medical information becomes digitally available through the hospital management system using data stored in or accessed via the central database.",
    "10. System administrator reviews a summary of the applied configurations for central database storage and electronic medical record integration → System presents a confirmation message indicating that all system data is now configured to be stored in the central database and that electronic medical records are integrated with the management system."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): Central database configuration already defined and only needs verification. Condition: The system administrator determines that existing central database connection parameters are already configured and correct. Flow: At Step 3, the system administrator reviews the displayed central database configuration without changing the parameters → The system revalidates the existing configuration and confirms that the central database connection remains available → The flow continues at Step 6.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 7): Electronic medical record integration parameters are partially preconfigured. Condition: The system already contains default or previously saved electronic medical record integration parameters. Flow: At Step 7, the system administrator reviews and confirms the preconfigured parameters without modification → The system validates the existing parameters and, if valid, proceeds directly to attempt integration at Step 8.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 9): Electronic medical record integration is logically enabled through existing central database views. Condition: The electronic medical record data is already replicated or exposed through the central database, and no direct external connection is required. Flow: At Step 9, instead of establishing a new external connection, the system activates integration by enabling predefined views or mappings in the central database to electronic medical record data → The system confirms that patient medical information is digitally available through these views → The flow continues at Step 10."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 4): Central database connection attempt fails. Condition: The system cannot connect to the specified central database using the provided parameters. Flow: At Step 4, the system detects a connection error (for example, due to network failure or invalid host information) → The system displays an error message describing that the central database connection could not be established and indicates which parameters may require correction → The system does not enable central database storage and retains the prior data storage configuration → The use case ends without changing data storage behavior.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 5): Central database becomes unavailable after configuration. Condition: The central database connection was initially successful but becomes unavailable during subsequent verification actions related to this use case. Flow: After Step 5, the system detects loss of connectivity to the central database during configuration verification → The system logs the connectivity failure and displays a warning to the system administrator that central database storage cannot be guaranteed → The system maintains the configuration state but flags the storage subsystem as degraded and instructs the system administrator to resolve the issue before relying on central storage → The use case ends with central storage configuration pending effective operation.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 8): Electronic medical record integration connection attempt fails. Condition: The system cannot establish a connection or data link with the electronic medical record system using the provided parameters. Flow: At Step 8, the system detects a failure to connect or validate the electronic medical record integration → The system displays an error message indicating that electronic medical record integration could not be activated and requests that the system administrator review the integration parameters → The system does not activate electronic medical record integration and preserves the previous integration state, if any → The use case ends with the system continuing to operate without new electronic medical record integration.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 9): Electronic medical record data mapping validation fails. Condition: The system establishes technical connectivity but detects inconsistencies or incompatibilities in electronic medical record data mapping required for integration. Flow: At Step 9, the system validates the structure and mapping of electronic medical record data and identifies incompatible or missing fields → The system logs the validation errors and displays a detailed error summary to the system administrator → The system does not finalize activation of electronic medical record integration until the mapping issues are resolved → The use case ends without enabling electronic medical record integration."
