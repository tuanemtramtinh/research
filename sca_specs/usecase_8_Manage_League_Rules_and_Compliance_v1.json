  "description": "This use case describes how the IFA defines and maintains competition rules, configures rule-based constraints for scheduling and officiating, and tracks team transactions to ensure ongoing compliance with league rules and to avoid actual or perceived unfair advantages.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA decides to configure or update league rules and compliance parameters for a competition or to review compliance-related settings.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA is authenticated in the IFA Competition Management System.",
    "The IFA has the required authorization to manage league rules and compliance configurations.",
    "At least one league and its associated competitions exist in the system."

  "postconditions": [
    "Competition rulesets are stored in the system and associated with the correct leagues and competitions.",
    "Scheduling and match official assignment constraints derived from the league rules are saved and available for scheduling functions.",
    "Team transaction tracking rules are configured so that every team transaction is recorded for compliance monitoring.",

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the IFA actor represents one or more authorized system users acting on behalf of the IFA organization.",
    "It is assumed that leagues and competitions are already registered in the system before rules are configured for them.",
    "It is assumed that detailed rule logic (such as conditions on match official assignments or transaction checks) is expressible through configuration parameters supported by the system, and that no custom programming is required within this use case.",
    "It is assumed that actual schedule generation and match official assignment are handled by separate use cases that consume the rules and constraints configured in this use case.",
    "It is assumed that transaction-entry activities by teams or other actors are handled by other use cases, and this use case focuses on defining that all such transactions must be tracked and associated with the correct league rules.",
    "It is assumed that the system maintains an audit trail of configured rule changes so that later compliance checks can reference historical configurations."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow the IFA to input and store different rulesets for different competitions so that no mistakes will be made in updating leaderboards, scheduling matches or auditing budgets.",
    "The system shall associate each configured ruleset with one or more specific competitions and their corresponding leagues.",
    "The system shall ensure that every team transaction in the system is tracked and stored in a way that allows verification against the applicable league rules so that the IFA can make sure the team is following their league’s rules.",
    "The system shall provide configuration options that allow the IFA to define constraints intended to avoid bias in competition scheduling, such as preventing lighter schedules for specific teams, so that the IFA can avoid any claims of unfair advantages.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to configure league rules that are automatically applied during scheduling and match official assignment, including rules that prevent the same match officials from officiating the same team multiple times, so that the IFA can avoid claims about match officials causing an unfair advantage.",
    "The system shall apply the configured rules and constraints consistently whenever schedules, match official assignments, or compliance checks are generated by related use cases.",
    "The system shall store rule and constraint configurations in a persistent manner so that they remain effective until explicitly modified by the IFA.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to review existing competition rulesets and compliance configurations to verify that they reflect current league policies."

  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The specific data model and structure required to express complex competition rulesets (e.g., conditions affecting leaderboards, scheduling, and budgets) have not been fully defined.",
    "The acceptable criteria and metrics for determining a 'lighter schedule' and quantifying scheduling bias have not been specified.",
    "The detailed parameters for the rule that prevents the same match officials from officiating the same team multiple times (e.g., over what time period or number of games) have not been clarified.",
    "The extent and format of transaction tracking required for budget auditing and compliance checks (e.g., transaction categories, approval metadata, and supporting documents) remain to be determined.",
    "Policies for how historical rule changes impact the interpretation of past schedules, assignments, and transactions have not yet been established."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. IFA selects league and competition for configuration → System displays available leagues and competitions and confirms the selected league and competition context.",
    "2. IFA initiates competition ruleset management → System displays the current ruleset for the selected competition or indicates that no ruleset is configured.",
    "3. IFA defines or updates general competition rules (including parameters for leaderboards, scheduling constraints, and budget-related rules) → System records the entered general competition rule parameters and validates them for completeness and basic consistency.",
    "4. IFA configures scheduling fairness constraints to avoid biased schedules (such as constraints intended to prevent lighter schedules for specific teams) → System stores the scheduling fairness constraints and associates them with the selected competition.",
    "5. IFA configures match official assignment rules to avoid unfair advantages (including rules preventing the same match officials from officiating the same team multiple times) → System stores the match official assignment rules and links them to the relevant competition and its matches.",
    "6. IFA confirms that all team transactions for the competition must be tracked for compliance with league rules → System ensures that tracking is enabled for team transactions related to the competition and associates them with the applicable ruleset.",
    "7. IFA reviews a summary of the configured rules, scheduling constraints, assignment rules, and transaction tracking settings → System presents a consolidated configuration summary showing how the rules will be applied.",
    "8. IFA saves the rules and compliance configuration for the competition → System commits the configuration, makes it available to scheduling, assignment, and transaction-monitoring functions, and confirms successful completion of rule and compliance management."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): If no ruleset exists for the selected competition, the system indicates that this is a new configuration and displays empty default fields for general competition rules, scheduling fairness constraints, match official assignment rules, and transaction tracking settings, after which the flow continues at Step 3.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 3): If the IFA chooses to reuse or copy rules from another competition instead of defining all rules manually, the system allows the IFA to select an existing competition ruleset to copy, prepopulates the general rules and constraints from that ruleset, and then the IFA may adjust the copied values before continuing at Step 4.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): If the IFA decides that the presented configuration summary requires additional refinement, the IFA navigates back to the relevant configuration sections to adjust rules or constraints, and the system updates the summary accordingly before the IFA proceeds again to Step 8."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): If the system cannot retrieve the list of leagues and competitions due to a data access error, the system displays an error message indicating that league and competition information is temporarily unavailable, logs the error, and the use case terminates without changing any rules or configurations.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): If the general competition rule parameters entered by the IFA fail validation or contain inconsistent values, the system highlights the invalid fields, displays validation messages describing the issues, prevents the configuration from being saved, and returns control to the IFA to correct the values before continuing.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 8): If the system encounters a failure while saving the rules and compliance configuration, the system displays an error message stating that the configuration could not be saved, logs the failure, retains the previous active configuration, and terminates the use case without activating the new configuration."
