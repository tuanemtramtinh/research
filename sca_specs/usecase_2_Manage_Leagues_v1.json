  "description": "This use case describes how the IFA, via the IFA administrator and IFA manager, manages leagues and their teams within the system, including adding new leagues, registering teams, approving leagues and teams, enabling multilingual representation of league-related information, and ensuring that team transactions associated with leagues are tracked for rule compliance.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA administrator or IFA manager initiates an action to manage league-related data, such as adding a new league or registering a new team in the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA League Management System is operational and accessible to authenticated IFA personnel.",
    "The acting user has been identified as either an IFA administrator, IFA manager, or other IFA role with league management privileges according to organizational policies.",
    "Basic league management configuration of the system has been completed, including connectivity to any necessary internal data sources.",
    "The system has at least one supported language configured for league and team data presentation."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "Requested league and team management operations, such as adding leagues or registering teams, have been stored and are retrievable within the system.",
    "Newly added leagues and registered teams have an approval status that reflects any approvals made by the IFA manager during the use case execution.",
    "League and team records created or updated during the use case are associated with language-specific data where relevant, supporting multiple languages.",
    "Tracking of team transactions for the leagues affected by the executed operations is enabled or remains enabled in the system so that future transactions can be monitored for rule compliance."

  "assumptions": [
    "The IFA League Management System already provides authentication and authorization mechanisms that verify whether a user is an IFA administrator, IFA manager, or other IFA role before league management actions are allowed.",
    "The system already supports storage and retrieval of multilingual data, and this use case only configures or uses that capability for league and team-related information.",
    "The definition of a \"team transaction\" and the business rules governing such transactions are configured elsewhere in the system, and this use case only ensures that tracking is associated with the relevant leagues and teams.",
    "The existence of a detailed data model for leagues and teams, including fields such as league identifiers, team identifiers, and approval status, is assumed to be predefined by the system design.",
    "Any detailed league rulesets and financial or sporting regulations are configured outside the scope of this use case, and this use case only links leagues and teams to such rules for tracking purposes.",
    "The IFA as an actor in this use case is represented operationally by authorized IFA staff, including the IFA administrator and IFA manager, interacting with the system user interface."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. IFA administrator selects the league management function in the system → System displays the league management interface with options to view, add, and modify leagues.",
    "2. IFA administrator chooses to add a new league and provides required league details, including at least one language-specific representation of league information → System validates the entered league details and prepares a new league record in a pending state.",
    "3. IFA administrator submits the new league record for creation → System stores the new league in a pending approval status and records creation metadata.",
    "4. IFA administrator chooses to register one or more new teams for the newly created or existing leagues and enters the required team details → System validates the team details and prepares team records associated with the selected leagues in a pending state.",
    "5. IFA administrator submits the new team registrations → System stores the new team records in a pending approval status and records creation metadata.",
    "6. IFA manager accesses the league management function to review newly added leagues and teams pending approval → System displays lists of leagues and teams requiring approval with relevant summary information.",
    "7. IFA manager selects a pending league and reviews its details, including language-specific information → System presents full league details for review.",
    "8. IFA manager approves the pending league → System updates the league status to approved and makes the league available for operational use.",
    "9. IFA manager selects pending teams associated with leagues and reviews their details → System presents full team details for review, including league associations.",
    "10. IFA manager approves the selected pending teams → System updates the team statuses to approved and associates them actively with their respective leagues.",
    "11. IFA, through authorized personnel, enables or confirms transaction tracking for the approved leagues and their teams → System ensures that subsequent team transactions for these leagues are recorded and linked to the appropriate league and team records for rule compliance monitoring.",
    "12. IFA administrator or IFA manager confirms completion of the current league management session → System saves the final state and presents a summary of updated leagues and teams."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): IFA administrator provides league details in multiple supported languages instead of only one. Condition: The league operates across multiple language regions. System behavior: The system validates all provided language-specific fields, stores each language variant with the league record, and returns to Step 3 to continue with league creation.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): IFA administrator registers teams for an existing approved league instead of the newly created league. Condition: The league already exists and has approved status. System behavior: The system validates and stores the new team registrations as pending for the selected existing league, then proceeds directly to Step 5.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): IFA manager defers approval of a league after review. Condition: The IFA manager determines that more information is required. System behavior: The system leaves the league in pending status, records the deferral decision, and returns the IFA manager to the list of items requiring approval without proceeding to Step 9 for that league.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 10): IFA manager approves only a subset of pending teams while leaving others pending. Condition: Some teams need further verification. System behavior: The system updates the approved teams to approved status, keeps the remaining teams in pending status, and then continues with Step 11 for the approved teams only.",
    "AF-5 (from Step 11): Transaction tracking is already enabled for the relevant leagues and teams. Condition: The leagues and teams were configured for transaction tracking in prior sessions. System behavior: The system verifies existing tracking configuration, makes no changes, and proceeds directly to Step 12."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): Validation of new league details fails. Condition: Mandatory league fields or basic language-specific fields are missing or invalid. System behavior: The system rejects the submission, displays validation error messages specifying the incorrect or missing data, and prompts the IFA administrator to correct the details before attempting Step 2 again. The use case does not progress until valid data is provided.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): Validation of new team details fails. Condition: Mandatory team fields or league association data are missing or invalid. System behavior: The system rejects the team registration, displays validation error messages, and prompts the IFA administrator to correct the team information before reattempting Step 4.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 8): League approval cannot be completed due to a system error such as a database write failure. Condition: A technical error occurs while updating the league status. System behavior: The system logs the error, informs the IFA manager that the approval operation failed, leaves the league in pending status, and instructs the user to retry later or contact support. The use case terminates for this league without altering its status.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 10): Team approval cannot be completed due to a system error such as a database write failure. Condition: A technical error occurs while updating team statuses. System behavior: The system logs the error, informs the IFA manager that the approval operation failed, leaves the affected teams in pending status, and instructs the user to retry later or contact support. The use case terminates for these teams without altering their status.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 11): Enabling or confirming transaction tracking fails. Condition: A configuration or technical error prevents transaction tracking from being set for the selected leagues and teams. System behavior: The system logs the error, notifies the acting IFA user that tracking could not be ensured, does not mark tracking as successfully enabled, and terminates the current tracking configuration attempt while keeping league and team approval statuses unchanged."
