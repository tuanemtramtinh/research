  "description": "This use case defines how an IFA administrator creates new leagues and registers new teams in the IFA League Management System and how an IFA manager reviews and approves these leagues and teams to ensure that the system remains up to date and consistent with IFA integrity requirements.",

  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA League Management System is operational and accessible.",
    "The ifa administrator is authenticated and authorized to add new leagues and register new teams.",
    "The ifa manager is authenticated and authorized to approve leagues and teams.",
    "Required league and team information is available to the ifa administrator prior to data entry."

  "postconditions": [
    "All newly created leagues that have been submitted and approved are stored in the system with an approved status.",

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that only individuals in the role of ifa administrator can initiate the creation of new leagues and the registration of new teams.",
    "It is assumed that only individuals in the role of ifa manager can perform approvals of leagues and teams created or registered by ifa administrators.",
    "It is assumed that the system maintains internal status values to distinguish between pending and approved leagues and teams, even though these statuses are not explicitly described in the requirement text.",
    "It is assumed that the system validates that mandatory league and team data fields are provided before allowing the ifa administrator to submit them for approval.",
    "It is assumed that the system prevents an ifa manager from modifying the core identity attributes of leagues and teams (such as names and identifiers) during the approval step and limits them to approve or reject decisions.",
    "It is assumed that when the requirement mentions keeping the system up to date, it refers solely to data correctness and completeness regarding leagues and teams and does not imply any additional synchronization with external systems.",
    "It is assumed that the system maintains an audit trail of league and team creation, registration, and approval actions for integrity, even though audit functionality is not explicitly mentioned, and that this audit storage does not introduce new externally visible capabilities.",
    "It is assumed that there is no automatic or implicit approval; every league and team must be explicitly approved by an ifa manager before being considered active for operational use.",
    "It is assumed that the same use case is used both when creating the first league or team in the system and when adding additional leagues or teams at a later time."
