    "It is assumed that any audit logging of registration or approval actions is an internal system mechanism that does not introduce additional externally visible capabilities.",
    "It is assumed that there is no automatic approval; every league and team must be explicitly approved by an ifa manager before being considered active for competition purposes.",
