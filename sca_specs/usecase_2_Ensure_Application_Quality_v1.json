  "main_flow": [
    "1. Fan initiates access to the web application → System establishes a session for the fan and loads the default user interface.",
    "2. Fan reviews the displayed language of the user interface → System presents all visible interface elements in the currently configured language.",
    "3. Fan selects a preferred supported language for using the application → System applies the selected language and reloads or updates all relevant interface text and labels accordingly.",
    "4. Fan performs navigation and actions within the web application (such as viewing information pages or accessing features) → System processes each request and returns the requested content or result in the selected language.",
    "5. System handles incoming requests from all active users, including the current fan, while the number of simultaneous users is within the supported capacity → System allocates resources to serve up to the configured maximum number of concurrent sessions, maintaining access to the application.",
    "6. Fan issues one or more additional requests that require server-side processing (such as loading pages, submitting forms, or retrieving data) → System processes each fan request and returns the corresponding response within the configured acceptable response time under normal operating load.",
    "7. Fan continues to interact using the application in the chosen language → System consistently maintains the selected language for all subsequent responses during the session, subject to supported language coverage.",
    "8. System maintains service availability and response performance while concurrent usage increases up to the supported capacity limit → System continues accepting new user sessions and processing requests without denying access due to capacity under designed operating conditions.",
    "9. Fan finishes the interaction or logs out of the application → System terminates or marks the fan session as completed while having provided multilingual, fast-response, and high-capacity service characteristics during the interaction."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): Fan keeps the default language. Condition: The fan decides not to change the language and continues using the application in the default language presented by the system. Flow: The fan does not perform a language change action, proceeds directly to navigation and actions described in Step 4, and the system continues to use the default language for all subsequent responses.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): Concurrent users remain below typical load. Condition: The number of concurrent users is significantly below the configured maximum capacity. Flow: The system allocates fewer resources than the defined maximum thresholds but still processes all fan requests; the flow continues with Step 6, and the system may achieve response times faster than the configured maximum acceptable threshold.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): Fan changes the preferred supported language during the session. Condition: The fan decides to switch to another supported language while already interacting with the system. Flow: The fan selects a different supported language, the system updates interface text and subsequent responses to the newly selected language, and the flow continues with Step 7 and Step 8 using the new language."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): Selected language is not supported by the system. Condition: The fan attempts to select a language that is not configured as supported. Flow: The system rejects the selection, presents an explanatory message indicating that the requested language is unavailable, retains the previously active language, and returns the fan to the state prior to attempting the language change to allow selection of a supported language or continuation with the current language.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 5): Concurrent user load exceeds supported capacity. Condition: The number of concurrent users attempting to access the web application exceeds the supported limit under designed operating conditions. Flow: The system cannot accept additional sessions beyond the supported capacity, prevents the creation of new sessions, and displays an informative message to affected users indicating that the service is temporarily at capacity; existing active sessions, including the current fan session, continue as long as resources permit, and no further progression beyond this point occurs for users whose access was denied.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 6): System fails to respond within acceptable response time. Condition: Due to internal issues or load conditions, the system cannot generate a response for a fan request within the configured acceptable response time. Flow: The system records the performance issue, may time out the pending request, displays an appropriate timeout or error message to the fan, and stops processing the affected request; the fan may attempt the action again by re-initiating the relevant main flow steps."
