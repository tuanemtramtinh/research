  "stakeholders_and_interests": [
    "Patient: Wants to monitor the status of own laboratory tests and understand when results will be available.",
    "Doctor: Wants to track the status of requested laboratory tests to plan diagnosis and treatment.",
    "Laboratory Technician: Wants test status information to reflect actual laboratory processing progress.",
    "Healthcare Organization: Wants efficient and transparent communication of laboratory test progress to reduce manual inquiries.",

  "description": "This use case describes how a patient or doctor reviews the current status and progress of requested laboratory tests, including an indication of when the results are expected to be available, through the healthcare information system.",
  "triggering_event": "A patient or doctor decides to check the status of one or more laboratory tests in the healthcare information system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The actor is authenticated in the healthcare information system according to the applicable access control rules.",
    "The actor has an active user account with permissions to view the selected patient's laboratory test information.",
    "At least one laboratory test order for the relevant patient exists in the system.",
    "The laboratory information required for test status tracking is available in the system."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "The actor has been presented with the current status of the selected laboratory test orders.",
    "The actor has been presented with an indication of when the corresponding laboratory test results are expected to be available, if such information exists in the system.",
    "No laboratory test data or status information has been modified by executing this use case."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that detailed access control, including restrictions on which patient records a given actor may view, is handled by underlying security mechanisms and is already enforced before and during this use case.",
    "It is assumed that laboratory tests have been requested through another use case and that test orders are already stored in the system before the actor attempts to view their status.",
    "It is assumed that the laboratory system or laboratory personnel update test status and any expected completion time information in the healthcare information system via separate processes not described in this use case.",
    "It is assumed that both patients and doctors can access the system through appropriate interfaces (such as web or mobile) that provide equivalent functionality for viewing laboratory test status.",
    "It is assumed that only patients can view their own tests and doctors can view tests for patients they are authorized to treat, and that this authorization is validated by the system.",
    "It is assumed that presenting an \"indication of when the results will be available\" may be based on either explicitly stored expected completion times or on simple status descriptions such as \"pending\", \"in progress\", or \"completed\".",
    "It is assumed that the supporting actor \"laboratory technician\" interacts with other use cases to enter or update laboratory test statuses, rather than directly participating in this viewing use case."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow a patient to review the status of their laboratory tests so that they have an indication of when the results will be available.",
    "The system shall allow a doctor to review the status of laboratory tests for patients under their care so that they have an indication of when the results will be available.",
    "The system shall present the current status for each laboratory test order that matches the actor's search or selection criteria.",
    "The system should present, where available, an indication of when the laboratory test results are expected to be available for each displayed test order.",
    "The system shall restrict visibility of laboratory test status information to authenticated users with appropriate access rights."

  "priority": "High",
  "risk": "Medium",
  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The precise format and terminology for laboratory test statuses (for example, \"ordered\", \"received\", \"in progress\", \"completed\") need to be defined.",
    "The method used to derive or store the indication of when results will be available (for example, fixed SLA rules versus explicit expected completion timestamps) needs to be specified.",
    "The maximum historical period or volume of laboratory tests that can be retrieved and displayed in a single view has not been defined.",
    "The detailed rules determining which patient tests a doctor is authorized to view (for example, primary physician only or any attending doctor) require clarification.",
    "The behavior of the system when laboratory status information is temporarily unavailable due to integration or network issues needs to be specified."
  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. Patient or doctor selects the option to view laboratory test status in the healthcare information system interface → System displays a laboratory test status search or selection screen for the actor.",
    "2. Patient or doctor identifies the patient context whose laboratory tests they want to review (for example, implicitly own identity for a patient or selecting a patient record for a doctor) → System validates that the actor is authorized to view laboratory test information for the identified patient and confirms the active patient context.",
    "3. Patient or doctor specifies any desired filter or search criteria for laboratory tests, such as time period, test type, or status, or accepts default criteria → System retrieves all laboratory test orders for the active patient context that match the specified criteria from the laboratory test records.",
    "4. Patient or doctor requests to display the matching laboratory tests → System presents a list of matching laboratory test orders with key attributes such as test name, ordering doctor, request date, and current status for each test.",
    "5. Patient or doctor selects a specific laboratory test from the list to view detailed status information → System displays detailed information for the selected laboratory test, including the current status and, where available, an indication of when the test results are expected to be available.",
    "6. Patient or doctor optionally reviews status details for additional laboratory tests from the list → System updates the detailed view for each newly selected laboratory test while maintaining access to the overall list.",
    "7. Patient or doctor indicates that they have finished reviewing laboratory test status information → System closes the laboratory test status view and returns the actor to the previous screen or main menu."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): Actor chooses not to provide any explicit filter criteria and relies on default settings → System applies default criteria, such as retrieving all recent or currently pending laboratory tests for the active patient context, and then continues with Step 4.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): The number of matching laboratory test orders exceeds the display limit for a single page → System segments the results into multiple pages or allows scrolling and provides navigation controls; the flow then continues with Step 5 when the actor selects a laboratory test.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 5): Actor reviews the summary information in the list and decides that detailed information for a specific test is not required → System keeps the list of laboratory tests displayed, and the flow continues directly with Step 6 if the actor later selects a test or with Step 7 if the actor exits the view."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): The actor is not authorized to view the selected patient's laboratory test information → System denies access, displays an authorization error message, does not show any laboratory test status data, and returns the actor to a safe previous screen or main menu; the use case ends unsuccessfully.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): No laboratory test orders exist in the system for the active patient context that match the specified or default criteria → System informs the actor that no laboratory tests were found for the selected criteria, displays no results list, and allows the actor to modify the criteria or exit to the previous screen; if the actor exits, the use case ends without displaying any test status information.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): A temporary technical or integration error occurs while retrieving laboratory test orders from the underlying data source → System displays an error message indicating that laboratory test status information is currently unavailable, logs the error for further investigation, and returns the actor to the previous screen or main menu; the use case ends unsuccessfully.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 5): Detailed information for the selected laboratory test cannot be retrieved because the record is missing or corrupted → System informs the actor that detailed information for the selected test is unavailable, keeps the list of laboratory tests visible, and allows the actor to select another test or exit; if the actor exits, the use case ends without showing detailed status for that test."
