  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the IFA administrator accesses the administrator dashboard through a standard web browser interface of the IFA Web Application.",
    "It is assumed that authentication is handled by an existing Authentication Service and that this use case starts after successful login, even though login is not detailed in the given requirements.",
    "It is assumed that the leagues and teams information presented on the administrator dashboard is read-only in the context of this use case and that any creation or modification of such data is handled by other use cases.",

    "It is assumed that only users with the IFA administrator role can access the administrator dashboard.",
    "It is assumed that the information shown on the dashboard is limited to leagues and teams, as explicitly mentioned in the requirement text.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. IFA administrator selects the option to access the administrator dashboard in the web application → System receives the request to open the administrator dashboard for the authenticated IFA administrator.",
    "2. IFA administrator waits while the dashboard loads → System retrieves current leagues information relevant to the IFA administrator from its data stores.",
    "3. IFA administrator continues to wait while information is prepared → System retrieves current teams information relevant to the IFA administrator from its data stores.",
    "4. IFA administrator views the loaded dashboard → System composes an overview dashboard containing the retrieved leagues and teams information for display.",
    "5. IFA administrator reviews leagues and teams information on the dashboard → System renders the administrator dashboard in the web application interface for the IFA administrator.",
    "6. IFA administrator may continue to observe or scroll through the dashboard content → System maintains the display of the administrator dashboard and keeps the retrieved leagues and teams information available for viewing during the session."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 1): If the IFA administrator is already located on a default landing page that includes the administrator dashboard as the initial view, the IFA administrator opens the web application and is directly presented with the administrator dashboard without selecting a separate option, after which the flow continues from Step 4.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): If the IFA administrator requests a manual refresh of the visible information while remaining on the administrator dashboard, the system re-retrieves current leagues and teams information from its data stores and re-renders the administrator dashboard with updated information, after which the flow continues from Step 5."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): If the system determines that the current user is not authenticated as an IFA administrator when attempting to access the administrator dashboard, the system denies access to the administrator dashboard and redirects the user to an appropriate authentication or authorization error page, and the use case ends without displaying the administrator dashboard.",
    "EF-2 (from Steps 2 and 3): If the system cannot retrieve leagues or teams information due to a data access or internal error, the system logs the error, displays an error message indicating that leagues and teams information cannot be loaded at this time, and does not display incomplete or inconsistent dashboard content, and the use case ends after presenting the error message.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 5): If the system takes longer than the configured maximum loading time to render the administrator dashboard, the system displays a timeout or temporary unavailability message to the IFA administrator instead of the dashboard content, and the use case ends without successfully presenting the administrator dashboard."

  "information_for_steps": [
