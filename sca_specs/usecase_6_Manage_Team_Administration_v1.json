  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA Integrated League Management System is operational and accessible.",
    "The team manager has an active authenticated account associated with the relevant team.",
    "The IFA budget auditor has an active authenticated account with auditing privileges.",

    "The financial and budget management capabilities referenced in the requirements are limited to data entry, update, and reporting within the system and do not include external financial transactions such as payments or banking integrations.",
    "The IFA has predefined a set of role types and associated system privileges that can be assigned by the team manager within the team context.",

    "Budget reports requested by the IFA budget auditor are generated from data already stored in the system without requiring external data sources.",
    "Audit control by the IFA budget auditor is performed by viewing and analyzing data and reports within the system rather than by modifying league rules or financial policies.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. team manager → The team manager logs into the IFA Integrated League Management System and selects the team administration area for the team they manage, and the system verifies the team manager’s authentication and displays only the tools relevant to the team manager role according to IFA-configured access restrictions.",
    "2. team manager → The team manager chooses the finance management function for the selected team, and the system displays the team’s current financial and budget-related data and available finance management options permitted for the team manager role.",
    "3. team manager → The team manager enters or updates team financial and budget-related data such as income, expenses, and budget allocations for the team, and the system validates the entered data according to predefined business rules and temporarily highlights any fields that require correction.",
    "4. team manager → After confirming the financial updates, the team manager submits the changes, and the system stores the updated team financial and budget-related data and records the change for audit purposes.",
    "5. team manager → The team manager selects the roles and privileges management function for team members, and the system displays a list of existing team members together with their currently assigned roles and system privileges that the team manager is allowed to modify.",
    "6. team manager → The team manager assigns or updates roles for selected team members based on available role types, and the system updates the stored role assignments and ensures that only role types allowed by the IFA configuration are selectable.",
    "7. team manager → The team manager assigns or adjusts system privileges for selected team members in accordance with the IFA-defined privilege model, and the system stores the updated privilege settings and enforces that only privileges permitted for the team manager to grant are assignable.",
    "8. ifa budget auditor → The IFA budget auditor logs into the IFA Integrated League Management System and selects the budget audit function for a specific team, and the system verifies the auditor’s authentication and authorization and displays budget management data for the selected team according to IFA-configured access restrictions.",
    "9. ifa budget auditor → The IFA budget auditor reviews the displayed team budget management data to evaluate the team’s financial behavior, and the system enables navigation through the relevant budget data and associated records without exposing tools that are not relevant to the auditor role.",
    "10. ifa budget auditor → The IFA budget auditor requests a system-generated report about the selected team’s budget management, and the system compiles the relevant budget and financial data for the team and generates a structured budget management report.",
    "11. ifa budget auditor → The IFA budget auditor views or downloads the generated budget management report, and the system presents the report in a readable format and records that the report was generated for audit traceability.",
    "12. ifa → The IFA accesses the system’s access configuration settings for user roles and tools, and the system displays the current mapping between user roles, tools, and system privileges.",
    "13. ifa → The IFA updates the configuration to restrict user access so that only relevant tools and functions are available for each role, and the system stores the updated access configuration and immediately applies the new restrictions to subsequent sessions and role-based operations.",
    "14. system → The system confirms completion of the team administration activities by ensuring that stored financial data, role and privilege assignments, and any generated budget reports reflect the latest changes and remain accessible according to IFA-configured access restrictions."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): If the team manager navigates directly to the roles and privileges management function without first accessing the finance management function, the system displays the list of team members with their current roles and privileges as described in Step 5, and the flow continues at Step 5.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): If the team manager filters team members by role or status before assigning or updating roles, the system applies the specified filters and displays only the matching subset of team members, after which the team manager proceeds with role assignment in Step 6.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): If the IFA budget auditor selects a different team while using the budget audit function, the system updates the display to show budget management data for the newly selected team and the flow continues at Step 9 for that team.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 10): If the IFA budget auditor chooses to adjust report parameters such as time period or budget categories before generating the report, the system applies the selected parameters when compiling data for the report and then completes report generation as in Step 10 before proceeding to Step 11."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): If the team manager’s authentication fails or the account is not associated with any team, the system denies access to the team administration area, displays an appropriate error message, and the use case terminates without making any changes.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): If the system detects invalid or incomplete financial data during validation, the system rejects the submission, displays specific validation error messages for the affected fields, and prompts the team manager to correct the data; the main flow resumes at Step 3 after correction.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 6): If the team manager attempts to assign a role that is not permitted by the IFA configuration, the system prevents the assignment, displays an error indicating that the role is not allowed, and keeps existing role assignments unchanged; the main flow resumes at Step 6 with permissible role selections.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 7): If the team manager attempts to grant a system privilege that exceeds the team manager’s granting authority, the system blocks the change, displays a warning that the privilege cannot be assigned, and retains the previous privilege configuration; the main flow resumes at Step 7 with allowed privileges.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 8): If the IFA budget auditor lacks authorization for the selected team’s budget data, the system denies access to that team’s budget audit function, displays an authorization error, and allows the auditor to select another authorized team or exit the budget audit function.",
    "EF-6 (from Step 10): If an internal error occurs while generating the budget management report, the system logs the error, informs the IFA budget auditor that the report could not be generated, and provides the option to retry report generation or return to reviewing the on-screen budget data.",
    "EF-7 (from Step 13): If the IFA attempts to apply an access configuration that would remove all tools for a mandatory role or violate a core system rule, the system rejects the configuration change, displays a message describing the conflict, and preserves the previous valid configuration; the main flow resumes at Step 12 for further adjustment."
