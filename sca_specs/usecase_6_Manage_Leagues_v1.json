    "ifa: Requires consolidated management of all leagues in one system to avoid redundant data and to access necessary data efficiently.",

  "description": "This use case describes how the IFA and the IFA administrator use the system to manage leagues, including adding new leagues, registering teams to the system under relevant leagues, and maintaining league-related data in a single central location.",
  "triggering_event": "The ifa administrator or the ifa decides to create or update league-related information in the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA League Management System is operational and reachable by the actors.",
    "The ifa administrator and the ifa have authenticated access to the system.",
    "The ifa administrator and the ifa have the necessary system privileges to manage league and team registration data.",
    "Basic reference data required for league creation, such as competition identifiers or organizational structures, is already configured in the system."

  "postconditions": [
    "New leagues created during the use case are stored in the system with their associated data.",
    "New teams registered during the use case are stored in the system and associated with their designated leagues or made available for later association.",
    "The central league repository in the system reflects the latest set of leagues and registered teams as managed during the use case.",
    "No redundant league entries or team registrations are introduced for the same identifiers according to the system’s validation rules."

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that user access restriction and role-based privileges are configured in the system so that only the ifa and the ifa administrator can perform league management operations referenced in this use case.",
    "It is assumed that league and team approval by the ifa manager is handled in separate approval use cases and is not part of this Manage Leagues use case.",
    "It is assumed that the system already has mechanisms to avoid redundant data (for example, unique identifiers for leagues and teams) and that this use case invokes those mechanisms when creating or updating records.",
    "It is assumed that language support, reliability for concurrent users, and multi-device access are provided by the underlying system infrastructure and do not alter the steps of this use case.",
    "It is assumed that the ifa administrator can associate teams with one or more existing leagues at the time of registration or leave them available for later association within the same league management functionality.",
    "It is assumed that only structural league and team registration data is maintained in this use case, while scheduling, budget control, statistics, and notifications are managed in other dedicated use cases."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow the ifa to manage leagues within the system so that all necessary league-related data is accessible in one central location.",

    "The system shall allow the ifa administrator to register new teams in the system so that team information remains up to date.",
    "The system shall store league and team data in such a way that redundant storage of the same league or team information is avoided.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. ifa administrator → The ifa administrator selects the league management function after successfully logging into the system.",

    "3. ifa administrator → The ifa administrator chooses to add a new league and provides the required league data.",
    "4. System → The system validates the provided league data, including checks for duplicate or conflicting league identifiers.",
    "5. System → Upon successful validation, the system creates the new league record and adds it to the central league repository.",
    "6. ifa administrator → The ifa administrator selects the option to register new teams and provides the required team registration data, including any league association if applicable.",
    "7. System → The system validates the team registration data, including checks for duplicate or conflicting team identifiers.",
    "8. System → Upon successful validation, the system creates new team records and, where specified, associates them with the selected leagues.",
    "9. ifa → The ifa reviews the managed league information using the league management function to confirm that all necessary data is available in one place.",

  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): The ifa chooses to manage leagues instead of the ifa administrator. The ifa selects the league management function, views the list of existing leagues, and may review or update non-approval-related league information within the limits of their privileges. The flow then continues with Step 9 for review and confirmation of consolidated data.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): The ifa administrator registers teams without immediately associating them with a league. The ifa administrator provides team registration data and leaves league association fields unset. The system validates and creates team records that are available for later association. The flow then continues with Step 9 for review of league and team information.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 6): The ifa administrator registers multiple teams in a single batch operation using the team registration function. The ifa administrator provides a collection of team records with shared or differing league associations. The system validates each team in the batch and creates all valid teams, associating them with their respective leagues. Invalid teams in the batch are reported to the ifa administrator without preventing creation of valid teams. The flow then continues with Step 9."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 4): The league data fails validation due to missing mandatory fields or detected duplication. The system displays validation error messages indicating which fields must be corrected. The ifa administrator may modify the data and repeat Step 3 and Step 4. If the ifa administrator cancels the operation, the use case ends with no new league created.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 7): One or more team registrations fail validation due to missing mandatory fields or detected duplication. The system displays validation error messages for the affected team records. The ifa administrator may correct the team data and repeat Step 6 and Step 7. If the ifa administrator cancels the registration for those teams, the use case continues with any successfully created teams and then proceeds to Step 9.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 1): The system is unavailable or the actor authentication fails when attempting to access league management. The system displays an error indicating that authentication or system access is not possible. No league or team changes are made, and the use case terminates unsuccessfully.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 9): The ifa cannot retrieve the consolidated league information due to a data retrieval or storage error. The system displays an error message and logs the incident. The use case ends without confirming that all data is available in one place, although previously committed league and team records remain stored according to the system’s data integrity guarantees."
