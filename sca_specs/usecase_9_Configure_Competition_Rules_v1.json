    "IFA: Requires a single place to configure and control rulesets for different competitions to ensure fairness and regulatory compliance.",

  "description": "This use case allows the IFA to define, update, and apply competition-specific rulesets in the system so that leaderboards, match scheduling, match official allocation, and budget auditing operate according to league rules without bias.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA decides to define a new competition ruleset or modify an existing competition ruleset in the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA is authenticated in the IFA Competition Management System.",
    "The IFA has sufficient authorization to configure competition rules within the system.",
    "The competition or league for which rules are to be configured exists in the system.",
    "Relevant IFA internal policies and competition regulations are available to the IFA."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "A competition ruleset is stored in the system and associated with the selected competition or league.",
    "The stored competition ruleset is available for use by system processes that update leaderboards.",
    "The stored competition ruleset is available for use by system processes that schedule matches.",
    "The stored competition ruleset is available for use by system processes that support budget auditing.",
    "The stored competition ruleset includes configured constraints to reduce scheduling bias.",
    "The stored competition ruleset includes configured constraints for applying league rules on match official assignments where provided by the IFA."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "The term \"IFA\" in this use case refers to an authorized IFA representative with configuration responsibility, modeled as the primary actor \"ifa\".",
    "The system already contains registered competitions and leagues and supports associating rulesets with these entities.",
    "The system has internal capabilities to use stored competition rulesets when updating leaderboards, scheduling matches, allocating match officials, and supporting budget audits, but these operational processes are covered by separate use cases.",
    "Competition rules may include parameters for ranking, points allocation, tiebreakers, eligibility constraints, scheduling constraints, and officiating constraints, and this use case is limited to configuring these parameters, not executing them.",
    "Bias avoidance is implemented by allowing the IFA to specify configuration values and constraints in the ruleset; the system does not autonomously infer bias conditions beyond the configured rules.",
    "Application of league rules to match official assignments is limited to enforcing configuration explicitly entered by the IFA, such as constraints on repeated officiation of the same team.",
    "The IFA has defined the specific content of competition rules (for example, maximum number of times a match official may officiate a team) outside the system; the system only records and applies the provided values.",
    "Any validation of competition rules is limited to structural and consistency checks (for example, required fields present, value ranges) and does not include legal or regulatory validation.",
    "Only one ruleset at a time is active per competition for operational processes, and activation of a ruleset is determined within this configuration use case.",
    "Changes to an existing ruleset may affect future operations of scheduling, leaderboard updates, and budget audits but do not retroactively modify historical data unless defined by separate processes."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow the IFA to input and store distinct competition rulesets for different competitions.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to associate each configured ruleset with one or more specific competitions or leagues.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to configure parameters that control leaderboard updates for a competition.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to configure parameters that control match scheduling for a competition.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to configure parameters that support budget auditing for a competition.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to configure rules and constraints intended to avoid scheduling bias, such as constraints that reduce the likelihood of giving teams systematically lighter schedules when used by scheduling processes.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to configure league rules that constrain the allocation of match officials to games, including rules to limit repeated officiation of the same team by the same match officials when used by allocation processes.",
    "The system shall validate configured competition rulesets for completeness and basic consistency before allowing them to be saved or activated.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to activate or deactivate a configured competition ruleset for use by operational processes.",
    "The system shall maintain the configured competition rulesets in persistent storage so that they are available for subsequent system operations."

    "2. ifa chooses to create a new ruleset or edit the existing ruleset for the selected competition → System opens the competition rules configuration interface for the selected competition.",
    "3. ifa enters or updates parameters governing leaderboard and ranking behavior for the competition → System records the entered leaderboard and ranking rule parameters in the current ruleset working copy.",

    "6. ifa enters or updates parameters governing league rules that affect allocation of match officials, including constraints on repeated officiation of the same team by the same match officials, where such rules are provided → System records the entered match official allocation rule parameters in the current ruleset working copy.",
    "7. ifa reviews the configured competition ruleset summary for the selected competition → System presents a consolidated summary of all configured ruleset parameters for confirmation.",
    "8. ifa confirms and submits the competition ruleset for the selected competition → System validates the ruleset for completeness and basic consistency and, if validation succeeds, stores the ruleset in persistent storage and marks it as active for the selected competition.",

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): ifa decides to copy configuration from another existing competition ruleset instead of starting from a blank configuration → System allows ifa to select an existing competition ruleset as a template, copies its parameters into the current ruleset working copy for the selected competition, and then continues at Step 3.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 7): ifa identifies additional adjustments needed after reviewing the competition ruleset summary → System returns ifa to the competition rules configuration interface with previously entered data preserved, and the flow continues at the earliest step that corresponds to the section that ifa chooses to adjust (Step 3, Step 4, Step 5, or Step 6) and then proceeds again through Step 7 and Step 8."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 8): The ruleset validation fails because required competition rule parameters are missing or inconsistent → System displays detailed validation error messages indicating which parameters need correction, retains the current ruleset working copy without activating it, and returns ifa to the competition rules configuration interface so that corrections can be made before attempting Step 8 again.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 2): A system error occurs when loading existing competition or league data for configuration → System displays an error notification indicating that competition configuration data cannot be retrieved at this time, logs the error for investigation, and terminates the use case without modifying any existing rulesets.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 8): A persistence or system failure occurs while attempting to store or activate the competition ruleset → System reports that the configuration could not be saved, logs the failure details, leaves any previously active ruleset unchanged, and terminates the use case without activating the new ruleset."
