  "description": "This use case describes how an urban mobility planner monitors congestion effects of traffic measures within the system, receives notifications when measures lead to congestion, and obtains system-suggested congestion mitigation options to support the refinement of mobility proposals.",
  "triggering_event": "The urban mobility planner requests to monitor congestion effects for a selected traffic measure or solution within the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The urban mobility planner is authenticated in the Urban Mobility Planning Decision Support System.",
    "At least one traffic measure or solution scenario is already defined or selected within the system for evaluation.",
    "The Traffic Simulation Engine is available to provide congestion-related data for the selected measure.",
    "The Congestion Analysis Component has access to relevant traffic indicators produced by the simulation or evaluation process.",
    "Notification channels configured for the urban mobility planner are available for delivering congestion notifications."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "The system has evaluated congestion conditions for the selected traffic measure based on available traffic data.",
    "The urban mobility planner has been informed about whether the evaluated measure leads to congestion.",
    "If congestion is detected, at least one suggested congestion mitigation option has been presented to the urban mobility planner.",
    "The system has recorded the congestion evaluation results and any generated mitigation suggestions for later review."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the Urban Mobility Planning Decision Support System already provides or interfaces with a Traffic Simulation Engine capable of generating congestion-related indicators for defined measures, because the requirement text references modeling congestion and measuring congestion effects without detailing the underlying computation.",
    "It is assumed that the system continuously or on-demand derives congestion states from traffic indicators such as traffic volume, speed, and queue length, because the requirement only states that the planner wants to be notified if a measure leads to congestion.",
    "It is assumed that congestion notifications are delivered within the application user interface as in-system alerts or messages, because no specific communication channel (e.g., email, SMS) is mentioned.",
    "It is assumed that suggested congestion mitigation solutions are generated based on predefined rules, patterns, or best practices encoded in the Suggestion Engine, because the requirement states that the planner wants to get suggested solutions but does not specify the internal algorithm.",
    "It is assumed that the urban mobility planner explicitly selects which measure or solution scenario is to be monitored for congestion prior to initiating this use case, because the user stories refer to congestion caused by a measure.",
    "It is assumed that the same measure can be reassessed multiple times and that each reassessment may produce updated notifications and suggestions, because urban mobility proposals are typically iteratively refined.",
    "It is assumed that the system determines whether a measure leads to congestion using an internal congestion threshold configuration, because the requirement does not define explicit numeric criteria for congestion.",
    "It is assumed that suggested congestion solutions are presented as candidate options without being automatically applied to the underlying traffic measures, because the requirement limits the system role to inspiring the planner rather than autonomously changing measures."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall notify the urban mobility planner if the evaluation of a selected traffic measure indicates that the measure leads to congestion.",
    "The system shall identify whether a selected traffic measure leads to congestion based on available traffic indicators produced by the Traffic Simulation Engine.",
    "The system shall present suggested solutions for mitigating a detected traffic congestion associated with the selected measure so that the urban mobility planner can be inspired to solve the problem.",
    "The system shall associate generated congestion notifications and suggested solutions with the corresponding traffic measure or solution scenario for later review.",
    "The system should allow the urban mobility planner to explicitly initiate congestion monitoring for a chosen measure or solution scenario.",
    "The system should present congestion notifications and suggested solutions in a way that the urban mobility planner can view them within a single focused congestion monitoring view."

  "priority": "High",
  "risk": "Medium",
  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The precise quantitative thresholds and metrics for defining that a measure 'leads to congestion' (e.g., speed drops, delay times, queue lengths) remain to be specified.",
    "The desired timeliness and refresh rate of congestion evaluations (continuous monitoring versus on-demand runs) must be defined.",
    "The acceptable level of automation for generating congestion mitigation suggestions (rule-based, data-driven, or manual configuration) must be clarified.",
    "The expected format and level of detail for suggested solutions (simple tips versus fully parameterized alternative measures) must be agreed with stakeholders.",
    "The required persistence duration and auditability of congestion notifications and suggested solutions for decision traceability must be established."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Urban mobility planner selects a traffic measure or solution scenario to evaluate for congestion within the system → System displays the selected measure details and the current status of any existing congestion evaluations.",
    "2. Urban mobility planner initiates congestion monitoring for the selected measure → System requests congestion-related traffic indicators from the Traffic Simulation Engine for the selected measure.",
    "3. Traffic Simulation Engine provides congestion-related traffic indicators for the selected measure → System receives the traffic indicators and forwards them to the Congestion Analysis Component.",
    "4. Congestion Analysis Component processes the received traffic indicators → System determines whether the selected measure leads to congestion based on configured congestion criteria.",
    "5. System evaluates the congestion analysis result → System generates a congestion notification status for the selected measure indicating whether congestion is present or not.",
    "6. System prepares information for the urban mobility planner → System presents the congestion notification status together with key congestion indicators in the congestion monitoring view for the selected measure.",
    "7. Urban mobility planner reviews the presented congestion notification and indicators → System allows the planner to request suggested congestion mitigation options for the selected measure.",
    "8. Urban mobility planner requests suggested congestion mitigation options for the selected measure → System invokes the Suggestion Engine with the congestion analysis result and the characteristics of the selected measure.",
    "9. Suggestion Engine evaluates possible congestion mitigation options for the selected measure → System compiles a list of suggested congestion mitigation options ranked or organized according to internal rules.",
    "10. System presents suggested congestion mitigation options to the urban mobility planner → System records the generated congestion notification and associated suggested solutions with the selected measure as part of the decision support information."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 4): If the Congestion Analysis Component determines that the selected measure does not lead to congestion according to the configured criteria, the system sets the congestion notification status to indicate 'no congestion detected' and skips the invocation of the Suggestion Engine in Steps 7–9; the main flow then continues at Step 10, where the system records and presents a 'no congestion' result without any mitigation suggestions.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 7): If the urban mobility planner decides not to request suggested congestion mitigation options after reviewing the congestion notification and indicators, the system bypasses Steps 8 and 9 and proceeds directly to Step 10, recording only the congestion notification and indicators for the selected measure."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): If the system cannot obtain congestion-related traffic indicators from the Traffic Simulation Engine due to a technical failure or unavailability, the system informs the urban mobility planner that congestion monitoring for the selected measure cannot be completed at this time, logs the failure, and terminates the use case without generating a congestion notification or suggested solutions.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 8): If the Suggestion Engine fails to generate suggested congestion mitigation options due to an internal error or insufficient data, the system informs the urban mobility planner that no suggestions can be provided, records the error condition, and then proceeds to Step 10, recording only the congestion notification and any available indicators.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 1): If the urban mobility planner attempts to start congestion monitoring without a valid or fully defined traffic measure selected, the system rejects the initiation request, prompts the planner to select or define a valid measure, and the use case ends without further processing."
