  "preconditions": [
    "The CIO is authenticated in the administrative environment of the IFA Integrated Web Application Platform with sufficient privileges to configure system integration settings.",

    "It is assumed that any necessary data migration or mapping between existing systems and the integrated platform is handled within the scope of system integration configuration and does not introduce additional functional behavior beyond consolidation.",
    "It is assumed that all stakeholder categories referenced in the requirements (e.g., IFA administrator, team, referee, league, fan) are represented as stakeholder roles that can be associated with specific user interfaces in the integrated platform.",
    "It is assumed that security, authentication, and authorization mechanisms already exist in the platform and are reused to control stakeholder access to their respective user interfaces, without adding new security features.",
    "It is assumed that the integration process is performed in a controlled administrative environment and not during normal end-user operation, even though its effects become visible during normal use."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. CIO initiates a new system integration configuration session → System displays the integration administration interface with options to manage existing systems and stakeholder interfaces.",
    "2. CIO reviews the list of existing stakeholder systems available for integration → System presents an inventory of identifiable existing systems with basic metadata relevant to integration.",
    "3. CIO selects one or more existing systems to be merged into the integrated platform → System records the selected systems and prepares them for consolidation into the unified platform.",
    "4. CIO confirms the intention to merge the selected existing systems into the integrated platform → System applies the configuration to consolidate the selected systems under the integrated platform boundary.",
    "5. CIO defines stakeholder groups that will use the integrated platform (for example, based on roles available in the organization) → System stores the defined stakeholder groups and associates them with the integrated platform configuration.",
    "6. CIO configures a user interface layout and navigation structure for a first stakeholder group → System saves the configured user interface as the default interface for that stakeholder group.",
    "7. CIO repeats user interface configuration for each remaining stakeholder group that will use the integrated platform → System stores each stakeholder-specific user interface configuration and links it to the corresponding stakeholder group.",
    "8. CIO reviews a summary of the merged system configuration and associated stakeholder-specific user interfaces → System displays a consolidated overview of the integration status and stakeholder interface mappings.",
    "9. CIO activates the integrated configuration so that stakeholders start using the single merged platform with their assigned interfaces → System enables the integrated platform for operational use and routes stakeholder access through their configured user interfaces."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): CIO deselects one or more previously selected existing systems before confirmation of the merge → System updates the list of selected systems accordingly and returns to Step 3 for final selection.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): CIO decides to reuse an existing stakeholder grouping definition instead of creating new stakeholder groups → System retrieves the existing stakeholder groups and proceeds directly to Step 6 with those groups available for user interface configuration.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): CIO chooses to base the user interface for a stakeholder group on a previously defined interface template → System copies the selected template configuration to the current stakeholder group, allows minor adjustments, and then resumes at Step 7 for any remaining groups.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 8): CIO identifies a required adjustment to system selection or stakeholder interfaces during summary review → System allows the CIO to navigate back to the relevant configuration step (Step 3, Step 5, Step 6, or Step 7) to modify settings and then returns to Step 8 for updated review."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): The system cannot retrieve the list of existing stakeholder systems due to connectivity or access issues → System displays an error message describing that existing systems cannot be listed, logs the error for administrative review, and terminates the integration configuration session without applying any changes.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): The merge operation for one or more selected systems fails during consolidation → System reports the failure to the CIO with details of the affected systems, rolls back any partial merge related to those systems, preserves the pre-existing configuration, and returns the CIO to Step 3 to adjust the system selection or cancel the integration.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 9): Activation of the integrated configuration cannot be completed because of a platform configuration error → System notifies the CIO that activation failed, logs diagnostic information, keeps the previous operational configuration active, and returns the CIO to Step 8 to review and correct the configuration before attempting reactivation."
