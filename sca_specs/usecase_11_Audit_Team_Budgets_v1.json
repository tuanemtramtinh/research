  "stakeholders_and_interests": [
    "IFA budget auditor: Requires efficient tools to control and audit team budgets, reduce manual workload, and quickly understand a team’s financial situation.",
    "IFA: Requires that every team transaction is tracked so that team financial activities comply with the applicable league rules and can be verified when needed.",
    "Teams: Are subject to budget control and transaction tracking and require that budgeting and compliance checks are performed consistently and transparently.",

  "description": "This use case specifies how an IFA budget auditor uses the system to track all team transactions, control and audit a team’s budget management against league rules, and generate budget management reports for review and decision support.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA budget auditor initiates a budget audit for a specific team within the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA budget auditor is authenticated in the IFA League Management System with valid credentials.",
    "The IFA budget auditor has been granted authorization to view and audit team financial data in the system.",
    "The relevant team and league are already registered and active in the system.",
    "Team financial transactions have been recorded in the system prior to the audit.",
    "Applicable league financial rules for the selected team’s league are already defined in the system."

  "postconditions": [
    "The system has presented the IFA budget auditor with an overview of the selected team’s recorded transactions and budget management information.",
    "The system has completed an automated evaluation of the team’s budget management against stored league rules relevant to that team.",
    "The system has generated and made available a budget audit report for the selected team, summarizing transactions, budget status, and rule-compliance indicators for the audit period.",
    "The IFA budget auditor has access to the generated report for later retrieval and review."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that all team financial transactions relevant to auditing are entered or imported into the system by other existing system functions prior to running this use case; this use case only consumes already-recorded transaction data.",
    "It is assumed that league-specific financial rules used to evaluate team transactions and budgets are already configured in the system by roles and use cases outside the scope of this use case.",
    "It is assumed that the IFA budget auditor can select a team and an audit period using standard selection and filtering mechanisms provided by the system.",
    "It is assumed that the system stores generated budget audit reports in a way that allows later retrieval by authorized users, although the detailed storage and archival mechanisms are handled by other system components.",
    "It is assumed that the IFA, as an organizational stakeholder, defines which data elements constitute a team transaction and what constitutes a budget management violation, and that these definitions are reflected in existing system configuration.",
    "It is assumed that the system’s performance and capacity requirements (such as supporting at least 50,000 concurrent users) are addressed at the platform level and do not change the functional steps of this use case."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall enable the IFA to track every team transaction in the system so that the team’s adherence to league financial rules can be verified.",
    "The system shall allow an IFA budget auditor to view and control a team’s budget management information within the system for audit purposes.",
    "The system shall support the IFA budget auditor in auditing a team’s budget management by presenting relevant transaction and budget data in a structured manner.",
    "The system shall automatically evaluate recorded team transactions and budget data against preconfigured league financial rules to support auditing decisions.",
    "The system shall allow an IFA budget auditor to quickly obtain a system-generated report summarizing a team’s budget management and related transactions for a defined period.",
    "The system shall present in the generated report any detected deviations or compliance issues based on league financial rules, to assist the IFA budget auditor in assessing the team’s situation.",

  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The precise structure and content of the budget audit report (e.g., required sections, level of transaction detail, and formatting standards) are not defined and require clarification from the IFA.",
    "The rules for how league-specific financial regulations are parameterized and maintained in the system, and which role is responsible for updating them, are not specified and require a governance decision.",
    "The required retention period and archival policy for transaction data and generated audit reports are not specified and need to be defined by the IFA.",
    "The exact access control model for who besides the IFA budget auditor may view or download budget audit reports is not defined and must be determined.",
    "The time granularity and scope of an audit period (e.g., season, fiscal year, custom date range) require explicit specification.",
    "The behavior of the system when transaction data is incomplete or partially missing for the selected audit period is not described and needs clarification."
  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. IFA budget auditor selects the budget audit function in the system → System displays options to choose a team and audit parameters.",
    "2. IFA budget auditor selects a specific team to audit and defines the audit period and other available audit parameters → System confirms the selected team and audit criteria and displays a summary for confirmation.",
    "3. IFA budget auditor confirms the audit request with the chosen team and audit parameters → System retrieves all recorded transactions for the selected team within the defined audit period from the existing data store.",
    "4. IFA budget auditor waits while the system processes the audit → System analyzes the retrieved transactions and budget data against the applicable league financial rules for the selected team’s league.",
    "5. IFA budget auditor waits for the analysis outcome → System calculates budget balances, identifies any potential rule deviations or points of interest, and prepares structured audit data for reporting.",
    "6. IFA budget auditor views the audit results → System generates a budget audit report summarizing the team’s transactions, budget status, and rule-compliance indicators for the specified audit period.",
    "7. IFA budget auditor reviews the generated report on screen → System presents the report to the IFA budget auditor and provides options to navigate within the report and to store it for later retrieval.",
    "8. IFA budget auditor completes the audit review → System records that the audit report has been generated and remains available to authorized users for future consultation."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): IFA budget auditor selects a different audit period.\nCondition: The IFA budget auditor decides that the initially chosen audit period is not appropriate.\nFlow: The IFA budget auditor adjusts the audit period and audit parameters. → System updates the displayed summary of the selected team and audit criteria. The flow then continues with Step 3.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): IFA budget auditor chooses to export the budget audit report.\nCondition: The IFA budget auditor needs an external copy of the audit report for internal processes.\nFlow: The IFA budget auditor selects the option to export or download the report in one of the formats supported by the system interface. → System produces an exported copy of the report while keeping the original report available in the system. The flow then continues with Step 7."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): Selected team has no transactions in the chosen audit period.\nCondition: The system finds no recorded transactions for the selected team within the defined audit period.\nFlow: System informs the IFA budget auditor that no transaction data is available for the selected team and audit period and presents options to change the audit period or end the audit. If the IFA budget auditor changes the audit period, the flow resumes at Step 2; otherwise, the use case terminates without generating a report.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): Retrieval of transaction data fails.\nCondition: The system cannot retrieve transaction data for technical reasons such as data store unavailability.\nFlow: System notifies the IFA budget auditor that transaction retrieval failed and logs the failure for technical follow-up. The use case terminates without performing the audit or generating a report.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): League financial rules for the selected team’s league are missing or incomplete.\nCondition: During analysis, the system determines that applicable league financial rules are not available or are incomplete for the team’s league.\nFlow: System stops the automated rule-based evaluation, informs the IFA budget auditor that rule-based checks cannot be fully executed, and presents any available raw transaction and budget data without compliance indicators. The use case ends after presenting the available data without generating a complete rule-compliance report."
