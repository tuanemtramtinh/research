  "description": "This use case describes how a UMD employee accesses the simulation platform and views a real-time interactive map of Wonderland that displays an up-to-date street map, current traffic, traffic heat map, and real-time environmental measures including CO2 emissions, noise levels, and air pollution at overall and per-point levels.",

  "assumptions": [
    "The term \"simulation platform\" refers to the Wonderland Traffic Simulation and Monitoring Platform specified in the scope.",
    "Real-time data means that traffic and environmental data are updated with a delay that is operationally acceptable for monitoring but not necessarily instantaneous.",
    "The included use case \"access simulation platform\" covers user authentication, authorization, and basic platform startup, and is already defined elsewhere.",
    "The system aggregates sensor data from multiple physical sensors in Wonderland into coherent traffic and environmental indicators before visualization.",
    "The up-to-date map, traffic data, and environmental data are already preprocessed and stored in formats directly usable by the platform for visualization.",
    "The user interface is graphical and map-based, allowing panning and zooming of the Wonderland map, even though detailed UI behavior is outside the scope of this use case.",
    "Noise and air pollution legal limits are defined externally and are not configured or modified within this use case.",
    "The system continuously refreshes the displayed information without requiring the UMD employee to manually reload the page, unless explicitly requested.",
    "Environmental measures \"taken at points in the city\" are associated with identifiable geographic measurement points that can be displayed as markers on the map.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. umd employee initiates access to the simulation platform → System executes the included use case \"access simulation platform\" and establishes an interactive session for the umd employee.",
    "2. umd employee requests to view the real-time map of Wonderland → System loads and displays the up-to-date street map of Wonderland, including different road types and obstacles.",
    "3. umd employee views the base map view → System overlays current traffic information on the map using data gathered from sensors in Wonderland.",
    "4. umd employee requests visualization of traffic crowdedness → System displays a real-time traffic heat map on top of the street map, indicating crowdedness across Wonderland.",
    "5. umd employee requests environmental information → System overlays real-time environmental measurement points on the map, showing current values at each measurement point.",
    "6. umd employee reviews CO2 indicators → System displays the overall real-time CO2 emissions associated with the current traffic situation.",
    "7. umd employee reviews noise indicators → System displays the real-time noise level for each measurement point on the map.",
    "8. umd employee reviews air pollution indicators → System displays the real-time overall air pollution level for Wonderland and the real-time air pollution level per measurement point on the map.",
    "9. umd employee continues monitoring as the situation evolves → System continuously refreshes and updates the displayed traffic, heat map, and environmental data on the map in real time for the duration of the session."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 4): umd employee chooses to temporarily hide the traffic heat map layer and focus on raw traffic data only → System hides the traffic heat map overlay while continuing to display individual current traffic information on the map; the flow continues with Step 5.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): umd employee chooses to view only a subset of environmental measurement points (e.g., specific districts) → System filters the displayed environmental measurement points on the map according to the selected subset; the flow continues with Step 6.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): umd employee adjusts the zoom level or map region to focus on a particular area of Wonderland → System updates the map viewport and continues to display real-time traffic, heat map (if enabled), and environmental indicators for the visible area; the flow continues with Step 9."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): The system cannot complete the included use case \"access simulation platform\" due to authentication failure or platform unavailability → System denies access or shows an error message indicating that the platform cannot be accessed; the use case terminates without displaying real-time traffic or environmental information.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): Real-time traffic data from sensors is temporarily unavailable or incomplete → System displays the base street map and an explicit indication that current traffic information is unavailable or partially unavailable, and does not render missing traffic data; the use case continues with Step 4 if the umd employee still chooses to view available visualizations.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 5): Real-time environmental measurement data from one or more measurement points is unavailable → System displays available environmental measurement points and clearly indicates which points or indicators lack current data; the use case continues with Step 6 using only the available data.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 9): The connection between the client and the platform is interrupted during real-time monitoring → System stops updating the displayed data, indicates loss of connection to the umd employee, and attempts no further updates until connectivity is restored; the current execution of the use case ends."
