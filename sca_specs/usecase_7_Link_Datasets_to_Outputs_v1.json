  "description": "This use case describes how a depositor, academic publisher, or research information manager creates and maintains logical associations between datasets in the Bath Data Archive and related research outputs such as publications in Opus, external repository records, project data management plans, and project metadata, thereby providing a connected, discoverable research record and supporting reporting on compliance and impact.",
  "triggering_event": "An authorized actor decides to associate a dataset in the Bath Data Archive with one or more related research outputs or external data records.",

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the Bath Data Archive System provides user interface functions for managing dataset metadata as referenced by the include relationship to the manage dataset metadata use case; this assumption does not introduce additional capabilities beyond metadata management.",

    "It is assumed that the Bath Data Archive System can store and present persistent web links (e.g., URLs or DOIs) as metadata fields associated with dataset records and related outputs, without itself minting or managing those identifiers in this use case.",
    "It is assumed that the actor initiating the use case already knows or can obtain the necessary identifiers or references (such as publication identifiers, project identifiers, DMP references, or external repository links) from the relevant external systems.",
    "It is assumed that validation of identifiers or references entered by the actor is limited to format and basic consistency checks and does not require real-time verification against every external system.",
    "It is assumed that relationships between a dataset and multiple outputs or records are many-to-many and that creating or updating a linkage does not delete or invalidate existing linkages unless the actor explicitly performs a remove or overwrite action within the same metadata management context.",
    "It is assumed that integration with University systems such as Opus and project metadata sources is already configured at the infrastructure level, and this use case only records link information within the Bath Data Archive System.",
    "It is assumed that publishers and research information managers who act within this use case do so via interfaces or channels that allow them to edit or supply linkage metadata in the Bath Data Archive System, aligned with their roles."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Actor selects an existing dataset record to manage linkages → System retrieves and displays the current dataset metadata using the manage dataset metadata functionality.",
    "2. Actor chooses to manage links to publications and related outputs for the selected dataset → System presents a linkage management interface showing existing links to publications, project metadata, project DMPs, and external repositories.",
    "3. Actor initiates adding or updating a link between the dataset and one or more publications in Opus by providing publication identifiers or references → System records the provided publication identifiers in the dataset metadata and displays the updated list of linked publications.",
    "4. Actor initiates adding or updating a link between the dataset and one or more external repository records by providing persistent URLs or repository identifiers → System records the external repository references in the dataset metadata and displays the updated list of linked external data records.",
    "5. Actor initiates adding or updating a link between the dataset and the related project data management plan by providing the DMP reference or identifier → System records the DMP reference in the dataset metadata and displays the updated DMP linkage.",
    "6. Actor initiates adding or updating a link between the dataset and project metadata by providing or selecting the relevant project identifier or metadata reference → System records the project metadata reference in the dataset metadata and displays the updated project linkage.",
    "7. Actor reviews all newly added or modified links between the dataset and related outputs and confirms the changes → System validates the linkage data for required fields and basic format consistency and prepares the updated dataset metadata for saving.",
    "8. Actor submits the updated metadata and linkage information for the dataset → System saves the updated dataset metadata, including all linkage information, updates internal indexes for discovery and reporting, and displays a confirmation that the dataset has been successfully linked to the specified outputs and records."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): Actor chooses to link the dataset only to a subset of intended publications at this time and leaves additional publications to be linked later → System records the provided publication identifiers, leaves other potential publication links unset, and allows the actor to proceed to Step 4 or Step 7 as appropriate.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): Actor records only external repository links for the dataset without linking to any publications in Opus → System records the external repository references as the only current linkage type and allows the actor to proceed directly to Step 5, Step 6, or Step 7.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 5): Actor indicates that no formal project DMP exists for the dataset and skips adding a DMP link → System accepts the absence of a DMP linkage, retains any other linkage information entered, and allows the actor to proceed to Step 6 or Step 7.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 6): Research information manager adds only project metadata links without modifying existing publication or external repository links → System records the new project metadata references, retains existing linkages unchanged, and the actor continues with Step 7.",
    "AF-5 (from Step 2): Academicpublisher accesses the linkage management interface focused on connecting an article to an existing dataset by specifying the article identifier and the dataset identifier → System records the linkage between the article and the dataset within the dataset metadata context and then resumes with Step 7 for confirmation of the updated link set."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): System cannot retrieve the selected dataset metadata due to access restrictions or missing records → System informs the actor that the dataset cannot be accessed for linkage management, logs the incident according to operational procedures, and terminates the use case without making any changes.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): The publication identifier provided by the actor fails validation checks for mandatory fields or allowed formats → System rejects the invalid publication identifier, displays an error message indicating the validation issue, prompts the actor to correct the identifier, and does not proceed to Step 4 until a valid identifier is provided or the actor cancels adding that publication link.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): The external repository link entered by the actor is syntactically invalid or exceeds allowed length constraints → System rejects the external repository link, informs the actor of the format problem, and requests correction before proceeding; if the actor cancels the entry, the system discards the invalid link and allows continuation with remaining steps.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 8): A system error occurs while saving the updated dataset linkage metadata, such as a database failure or timeout → System rolls back the attempted metadata changes, preserves the previously stored state of the dataset record, notifies the actor that saving has failed, and terminates the use case; no partial linkage updates are committed."
