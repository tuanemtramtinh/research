  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA system is operational and reachable over the network from supported devices.",
    "The user has a valid user account in the IFA system.",
    "The user has access to a supported device type (mobile phone or desktop) with network connectivity.",

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the IFA system already supports an authentication mechanism that verifies user credentials without defining any new authentication features in this use case.",
    "It is assumed that device-specific presentation (for mobile phone versus desktop) is limited to layout and interaction adaptation and does not introduce any additional business functionality.",
    "It is assumed that role and privilege configurations that determine which tools and functions a user may access are defined elsewhere and are only enforced, not modified, by this use case.",
    "It is assumed that fans, team managers, team staff members, ifa employees, and match officials already possess or are provisioned with credentials prior to attempting to access the system.",
    "It is assumed that both mobile phone and desktop access occur through network-dependent interfaces such as a web application or equivalent, without defining any new offline capabilities.",
    "It is assumed that the requirement for accessing the system on the field or while traveling refers solely to network-reachable mobile access and not to additional match-control features beyond existing system functionality."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. User (fan, team manager, team staff member, ifa employee, or match official) opens the IFA system entry point on a supported device (mobile phone or desktop) → System detects the device type and loads the initial access interface appropriate for the detected device.",
    "2. User indicates intent to access the system by selecting the login or equivalent access option → System displays the authentication form suitable for the detected device type.",
    "3. User enters required authentication credentials and submits the access request → System sends the provided credentials to the authentication service for verification.",
    "4. Authentication service validates the submitted credentials and returns the validation result → System evaluates the returned validation result.",
    "5. System confirms that the user credentials are valid → System establishes an authenticated session for the user.",
    "6. System determines the user’s roles and associated privileges based on existing configuration → System selects the appropriate initial home screen and accessible navigation options for the authenticated user.",
    "7. System presents the authenticated home screen using a layout optimized for the user’s device type (mobile phone or desktop) → User gains access to existing system functionality consistent with the user’s roles and privileges."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 1): User switches device orientation on a mobile phone during initial access → System adjusts the layout of the initial access interface to match the new orientation while maintaining the same available access options, then continues with Step 2.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 2): User chooses a preconfigured quick-access option such as a remembered account on the device instead of manually navigating to a generic login option → System displays the same authentication form but with the user identifier prefilled, then continues with Step 3.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 3): User accesses the system from a desktop device with assistive input methods (for example, keyboard-only navigation) → System presents the authentication form with controls navigable using standard desktop input methods, then continues with Step 4.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 7): User chooses to switch from a mobile web interface to a desktop browser during an active session (for example, by logging in from a desktop shortly after mobile access) → System establishes a new authenticated session on the desktop, presents the desktop-optimized home screen, and may invalidate or maintain the prior mobile session according to configured security policy while preserving the same set of accessible functions."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): User submits incomplete or syntactically invalid authentication data (for example, missing required fields) → System rejects the submission, displays an error message indicating which fields are invalid without revealing security-sensitive information, and redisplays the authentication form for correction; the use case remains at Step 3.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): Authentication service indicates that the credentials are invalid → System informs the user that authentication has failed without disclosing which specific credential was incorrect and provides an option to retry the login process, then returns to Step 3 or terminates the attempt after configured retry limits are reached.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): Authentication service is unreachable or returns a technical error → System displays a message indicating that the system cannot complete access at this time, logs the failure, and terminates the current access attempt.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 1): Network connectivity is not available or is lost before authentication completes → System is unable to load or continue the access interface, shows an appropriate connectivity error where possible, and terminates the current access attempt.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 6): System cannot retrieve role or privilege information for the authenticated user due to configuration or data error → System logs the error, prevents completion of the login process for that user, displays a generic access error message, and terminates the current access attempt."

  "information_for_steps": [
    "1. Device type information (mobile phone or desktop), network endpoint URL.",
    "2. Access option selection, user intent to authenticate.",
    "3. User identifier, authentication credentials, device type context.",
    "4. Authentication request, authentication response status, error codes.",
    "5. Validated user identity, session identifier.",
