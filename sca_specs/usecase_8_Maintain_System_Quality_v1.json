  "description": "This use case describes how the IFA ensures that the system is configured to support multiple languages and that it maintains reliable performance for at least 50,000 concurrent users, resulting in a satisfactory user experience across different countries.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA initiates a request to configure or verify system language support and operational parameters to ensure reliable performance for high concurrent user loads.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA Integrated League Management System is deployed and operational.",
    "The IFA has the authority to define and modify system configuration for language support and performance-related parameters.",
    "Baseline hardware and network infrastructure required to run the system is already provisioned.",

  "postconditions": [
    "The system is configured to support the selected set of languages defined by the IFA for servicing leagues in different countries.",

    "The IFA has documented confirmation that language support and performance objectives have been applied within the system configuration."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that \"maintain system reliability for at least 50,000 concurrent users\" refers to sustaining acceptable response times and availability under that concurrent load without specifying exact performance metrics.",
    "It is assumed that the IFA interacts with the system through administrative interfaces that allow configuration of supported languages and performance-related options, even though such interfaces are not explicitly described in the requirements.",
    "It is assumed that the actual technical mechanisms for scaling and performance (such as load balancing, caching, or database optimization) are handled internally by the system or underlying infrastructure and are outside the scope of this use case.",
    "It is assumed that configuration of multiple languages is limited to selecting and enabling languages that are already implemented within the system and does not include creating new language translations.",
    "It is assumed that verification of the ability to support at least 50,000 concurrent users is performed using system-provided status or diagnostic information rather than separate external test tools.",
    "It is assumed that System Operations Personnel and System Configuration Administrator are organizational roles that act on behalf of the IFA and do not introduce new user-facing functionality.",
    "It is assumed that this use case addresses system-level quality configuration and verification and does not include end-user workflows such as logging in, managing leagues, or viewing content."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. ifa → The system displays an administrative interface for configuring system quality settings, including language support and performance-related options.",
    "2. ifa → The system presents the current list of available languages and indicates which languages are currently enabled for use.",
    "3. ifa → The system records the IFA’s selection of languages to be enabled for servicing leagues in different countries and updates the active language configuration.",
    "4. ifa → The system confirms that the updated language configuration has been successfully applied across relevant user-facing components.",
    "5. ifa → The system displays performance and capacity configuration options related to supporting at least 50,000 concurrent users.",
    "6. ifa → The system applies the selected performance-related configuration parameters intended to maintain reliability for at least 50,000 concurrent users.",
    "7. ifa → The system provides a summary view indicating that the selected language configuration and performance configuration are active and aligned with the IFA’s quality objectives, thereby confirming that system quality is maintained."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): If the IFA chooses to adjust the enabled language set without adding new languages, the IFA may modify the selection of enabled languages multiple times within the same session before confirming. The system updates the proposed language configuration after each modification and returns to Step 4 once the IFA confirms the final selection.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): If the IFA chooses to review current performance-related settings before changing them, the system first presents the currently active configuration for handling high concurrent user loads and any available explanatory information. After review, the IFA may either keep the existing settings, in which case the system skips applying new settings and proceeds directly to Step 7, or adjust the settings, after which the system applies the new configuration and then proceeds to Step 7."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): If the system fails to apply the selected language configuration due to an internal configuration error, the system logs the failure, displays an error message to the IFA indicating that the language configuration could not be updated, and retains the previously active language configuration. The use case terminates without updated language support.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 6): If the system cannot activate or validate the performance configuration intended to support at least 50,000 concurrent users, the system logs the issue, informs the IFA that the reliability configuration could not be applied as requested, and maintains the previously active performance configuration. The use case terminates with the prior reliability level still in effect.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 1): If the administrative interface for system quality settings is unavailable, the system notifies the IFA that quality configuration cannot be accessed at this time and records the incident. The use case terminates without any configuration changes."
