  "stakeholders_and_interests": [
    "IFA: Requires real-time visibility into teams' budget specifications to ensure regulations and financial policies are being followed.",
    "Teams: Require a convenient way to record every transaction, income, and expenditure in the system to avoid sending separate financial reports to the IFA.",
    "System Administrators: Require consistent, accurate, and complete transaction data to maintain system integrity and auditability.",
    "Auditors or Regulatory Bodies: Require reliable financial records to verify that financial transactions comply with applicable regulations and organizational policies."

  "description": "Allows teams to record their financial transactions in the system so that the IFA can view consolidated, real-time team budget specifications for monitoring against regulations and policies.",
  "triggering_event": "A team decides to record a new financial transaction or the IFA requests to view a team’s budget specifications.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA League Management System is operational and accessible to authenticated users.",
    "The team is registered in the system.",
    "The IFA user is registered in the system.",
    "The actor initiating the use case has valid access credentials.",
    "A team budget structure or account exists in the system for the team whose transactions will be recorded or viewed."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "The financial transaction entered by the team is stored in the system as part of the team’s budget records.",
    "The team’s budget overview and detailed specifications are updated to reflect the newly recorded transaction.",
    "The IFA can view an up-to-date representation of the team’s budget specifications for monitoring compliance with regulations and policies.",
    "All recorded financial entries remain available for later review and monitoring by authorized actors."

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that user authentication is handled by a separate, existing 'authenticate' capability that verifies user identity before allowing access to budget management functions.",
    "It is assumed that the term 'transaction, income and expenditure' refers to financial entries such as revenues and costs that affect a team’s budget.",
    "It is assumed that teams have permission to record only their own financial transactions and not those of other teams.",
    "It is assumed that the IFA has permission to view budget specifications for all teams.",
    "It is assumed that when the IFA monitors that teams fulfill regulations and policies, this use case only supports viewing the recorded budget data and does not itself evaluate or enforce compliance rules.",
    "It is assumed that real-time visibility means that once a transaction is successfully stored, it is immediately reflected in any subsequent budget views requested by the IFA.",
    "It is assumed that any detailed budget breakdowns or reporting formats are predefined in the system configuration and are not created or modified within this use case.",
    "It is assumed that concurrency of up to at least 50,000 users is supported by the broader system infrastructure and does not alter the functional steps of this use case."

    "The system shall allow the IFA to view the specifications of the budgets of the teams in real time.",
    "The system shall present budget information in a form that allows the IFA to monitor whether teams fulfill the defined financial regulations and policies.",
    "The system shall update the IFA’s view of team budget specifications immediately after a new transaction is successfully recorded by a team.",

    "7. system → The system validates the entered transaction details for completeness and basic format consistency.",
    "8. system → The system stores the validated transaction as part of the team’s budget records and updates the team’s budget specifications accordingly.",
    "9. system → The system confirms successful recording of the transaction to the team user and displays the updated budget view for the team.",

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 4): The team user chooses to review existing recorded transactions instead of recording a new transaction. Condition: The team user selects a 'view transactions' option. The system retrieves and displays the list of previously stored financial transactions for the team and then allows the user to proceed to Step 4 again if a new transaction is to be added.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 10): The IFA user selects to view budget specifications for multiple teams in sequence. Condition: After viewing one team’s budget, the IFA user selects another team. The system repeats Steps 13 and 14 for each newly selected team within the same authenticated session."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): The system determines that the team user’s authentication attempt has failed. The system denies access to budget management functions, displays an authentication error message, and logs the failed attempt. The use case ends for this actor without recording any transaction.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 7): The system detects missing mandatory fields or invalid formats in the transaction data. The system rejects the submission, highlights the invalid or incomplete fields, and prompts the team user to correct the data. Control returns to Step 6 after the user makes corrections.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 8): The system fails to store the transaction due to an internal error such as a database failure. The system displays an error message to the team user indicating that the transaction could not be recorded, does not update the budget data, and logs the error for later investigation. The use case ends for this transaction attempt.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 12): The system determines that the IFA user’s authentication attempt has failed. The system denies access to view budget specifications, displays an authentication error message, and logs the failed attempt. The use case ends for this actor without showing any budget data.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 13): The system is unable to retrieve budget data for the selected team due to missing data or a retrieval error. The system informs the IFA user that the budget information is temporarily unavailable, logs the issue, and does not display any incomplete or inconsistent budget information. The use case ends for this viewing attempt."
