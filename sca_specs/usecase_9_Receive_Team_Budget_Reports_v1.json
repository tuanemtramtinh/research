  "description": "This use case describes how an IFA administrator accesses and receives reports summarizing each team’s financial transactions through the web application to obtain a clear overview of team budgets.",
  "triggering_event": "The ifa administrator initiates a request to view or download team budget reports via the web application.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The ifa administrator has a valid account with permissions to access budgeting information.",
    "The ifa administrator is successfully authenticated in the IFA Web Application.",
    "Budgetary policies and rules are already defined in the system for teams’ budgeting data.",
    "Teams’ financial transaction data has been previously recorded and stored in the budgeting subsystem.",
    "Access to budgeting information is restricted to IFA administration and teams according to defined access control rules."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "The ifa administrator has successfully received a report containing each selected team’s financial transactions.",
    "The system has presented or delivered the requested team budget report in a readable and structured format.",
    "The reporting action is logged by the system for auditing and traceability purposes.",
    "The visibility of budget data remains restricted to authorized roles in accordance with budget confidentiality rules."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the IFA Web Application includes a budgeting subsystem capable of storing and aggregating team financial transactions without adding new functional capabilities beyond those implied by budget access and reporting.",
    "It is assumed that only authenticated ifa administrators with budget access rights can initiate the Receive Team Budget Reports use case, in line with the requirement to restrict access to budgeting information.",
    "It is assumed that transaction data and team budget information have been correctly entered or synchronized into the budgeting subsystem before the ifa administrator requests reports.",
    "It is assumed that the system already enforces access restriction to budgeting information for IFA administration and teams and that this use case operates within that enforced access control.",
    "It is assumed that the generated reports are read-only views of stored data and do not, by themselves, modify any budgeting or transaction records."
  ],
  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow an ifa administrator to receive reports of each team’s transactions so that a clear overview of team budgets is provided.",
    "The system shall present team transaction reports in a structured format that enables the ifa administrator to review each team’s financial transactions.",
    "The system shall make team budget reports available only to authorized IFA administration users, in compliance with the restriction of budgeting information to IFA administration and teams.",
    "The system shall use existing stored team transaction data as the source for generating team budget reports.",
    "The system shall log each access to team budget reports by an ifa administrator for audit and traceability."

  "priority": "High",
  "risk": "Medium",
  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The required level of aggregation and detail in the team budget reports (e.g., per transaction vs. summarized by category or period) is not defined.",
    "The preferred delivery format of reports (on-screen view, downloadable file formats, or both) is not specified.",
    "The acceptable time period for which reports can be generated (e.g., daily, weekly, seasonal, custom date ranges) is not defined.",
    "The retention policy for report access logs and any stored report artifacts is not defined.",
    "The need for filtering, sorting, or search capabilities within the report view is not specified."
  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. ifa administrator initiates a request to access team budget reporting functions through the web application → System verifies the ifa administrator’s authentication status and access rights to budgeting information.",
    "2. ifa administrator selects the team or set of teams for which budget reports are required → System displays a list or selection interface containing teams accessible to the ifa administrator based on defined access rules.",
    "3. ifa administrator specifies the reporting period or range of interest for financial transactions → System validates the provided reporting period against available transaction data.",
    "4. ifa administrator confirms the report generation request → System retrieves the corresponding financial transaction data for each selected team from the budgeting subsystem.",
    "5. ifa administrator waits while the system processes the request → System aggregates and compiles the retrieved financial transaction data into a structured team budget report for the selected teams and period.",
    "6. ifa administrator views the generated team budget report via the web application interface → System presents the compiled report, including each selected team’s financial transactions and budget totals, in a readable format.",
    "7. ifa administrator optionally saves or exports the displayed report using available interface controls → System completes the report delivery operation, records an audit log entry of the report access, and maintains budget data access restrictions."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): If the ifa administrator chooses to include all teams instead of selecting individual teams, the system shall provide an option to select all teams in one action and then proceed directly to Step 3 with all eligible teams preselected.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 3): If the ifa administrator chooses to use a predefined reporting period (such as a current season or a predefined fiscal period) rather than manually entering date ranges, the system shall allow selection of one predefined period and then continue with Step 4 using the chosen period.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 6): If the ifa administrator prefers to focus on a single team within a multi-team report, the system shall allow selecting that team from the displayed report view and then show a detailed view for that team while retaining the ability to return to the overall report without repeating earlier steps."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): If the system determines the ifa administrator is not authenticated or lacks required budgeting access rights, the system shall deny access to the reporting functions, display an authorization error message, and terminate the use case without revealing any budget data.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): If the specified reporting period falls completely outside the range of available transaction data, the system shall inform the ifa administrator that no data exists for the selected period, request a revised reporting period, and return to Step 3 without generating a report.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): If retrieval of financial transaction data from the budgeting subsystem fails due to a data access or internal error, the system shall notify the ifa administrator of the failure, log the error condition, and terminate the use case without presenting a partial or inconsistent report.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 5): If report compilation exceeds acceptable processing limits or encounters a processing error, the system shall cancel the report generation, inform the ifa administrator that the report could not be generated, log the incident, and end the use case without generating output.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 7): If saving or exporting the report fails due to a technical error, the system shall inform the ifa administrator that the export operation failed, retain the on-screen report view if possible, and log the export failure while leaving the underlying budget data unchanged."

  "information_for_steps": [
    "1. Administrator identifier, authentication token, role and permission data related to budgeting access.",
    "2. List of teams, team identifiers, access control filters determining which teams the ifa administrator may view.",
    "3. Reporting period definitions, start date, end date, or selected predefined reporting interval.",
    "4. Selected team identifiers, validated reporting period, query parameters for retrieving financial transactions.",
    "5. Retrieved transaction records per team, aggregation parameters, internal report structure templates.",
    "6. Compiled report content including team names, transaction lists, transaction dates, amounts, categories, and calculated totals per team and period.",
