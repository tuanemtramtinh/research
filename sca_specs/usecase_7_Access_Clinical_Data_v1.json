  "description": "This use case describes how a systems analyst collects, records, and accesses clinical and operational data, including bed occupancy data, room scheduling data, employee schedules, and appointment start and end times, by using the hospital management system, which relies on existing medical data management capabilities, so that prescriptive and predictive analytics can be performed.",

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that all clinical and operational data, including bed occupancy, room scheduling, employee schedules, and appointment times, are already collected and stored in a central database by other existing system functionalities described as medical data management.",
    "It is assumed that the relationship of type \"include\" to the target use case \"manage medical data\" means that this use case relies on existing mechanisms for centralized storage and management of medical and operational data and does not itself implement additional data collection or migration capabilities.",
    "It is assumed that the systems analyst has read access to anonymized clinical and operational data in accordance with privacy and security controls defined elsewhere.",
    "It is assumed that the systems analyst can initiate recording of appointment start and end times within the constraints of existing appointment data structures without modifying clinical content.",
    "It is assumed that data required for analytics can be retrieved through the hospital management system user interface without requiring direct database access."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Systems analyst requests access to analytics workspace within the hospital management system → System authenticates the systems analyst session and displays the analytics or data access interface.",
    "2. Systems analyst selects the option to load centrally managed clinical and operational data required for analytics → System invokes the included medical data management functionality to retrieve relevant data from the central database.",
    "3. Systems analyst specifies the clinical data scope and time range for analysis (for example, selecting clinical datasets related to patient encounters) → System retrieves the requested clinical data from the central database and prepares it for viewing by the systems analyst.",
    "4. Systems analyst selects to view bed occupancy data within the chosen scope → System displays bed occupancy data based on centrally stored information for the requested period.",
    "5. Systems analyst selects to view room scheduling data within the chosen scope → System displays room scheduling data based on centrally stored information for the requested period.",
    "6. Systems analyst selects to view employee schedules within the chosen scope → System displays employee schedule data based on centrally stored information for the requested period.",
    "7. Systems analyst initiates recording of appointment start and end times for the selected set of appointments or time window → System records the provided appointment start and end times in the central database and associates them with the corresponding appointments.",
    "8. Systems analyst reviews the collected and accessed clinical and operational data in the interface for completeness and suitability for analytics → System confirms that the requested datasets are available and consistently displayed for the systems analyst.",
    "9. Systems analyst confirms completion of data access for analytics preparation → System finalizes the data access session and maintains stored data so that it can be used by external analytics tools or processes."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): Systems analyst changes the clinical data scope or time range before viewing any specific dataset; the systems analyst adjusts filters for clinical data selection → System updates the selected clinical data scope and time range and then returns to Step 4 for subsequent viewing actions.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 7): Systems analyst chooses to import existing appointment start and end times that have already been captured by other subsystems instead of manually recording them → System retrieves the existing appointment start and end times from the central database via medical data management functionality and then proceeds directly to Step 8."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): The system cannot retrieve centrally managed data because the central database is temporarily unavailable → System displays an error message indicating that data cannot be loaded at this time, logs the failure, and terminates the use case without providing data for analytics.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): The requested bed occupancy data are not available for the selected period → System informs the systems analyst that no bed occupancy data were found for the specified criteria, allows the systems analyst to modify the selection parameters, and returns to Step 3.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 5): The requested room scheduling data are not available for the selected period → System informs the systems analyst that no room scheduling data were found for the specified criteria, allows the systems analyst to modify the selection parameters, and returns to Step 3.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 6): The requested employee schedule data are not available for the selected period → System informs the systems analyst that no employee schedule data were found for the specified criteria, allows the systems analyst to modify the selection parameters, and returns to Step 3.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 7): The system encounters a validation or storage error while recording appointment start and end times → System displays an error message describing that appointment times could not be saved, does not commit invalid data, logs the error, and returns to Step 7 to allow the systems analyst to attempt the recording again or cancel the recording operation."
