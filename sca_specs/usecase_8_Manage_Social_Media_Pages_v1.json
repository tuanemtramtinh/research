  "main_flow": [
    "1. Team → System Authentication Service: The team initiates access to the social media management functions and provides authentication credentials; the System Authentication Service validates the credentials and establishes an authenticated session.",

    "3. Team → System: The team chooses to create a new team social media page and enters required team page details; the system validates the input and creates the team social media page linked to the team account.",
    "4. Team → System: The team chooses to create new player social media pages and selects one or more players along with page details for each selected player; the system validates the input and creates the player social media pages linked to the corresponding players and the team.",
    "5. Team → System: The team chooses to create new coach social media pages and selects one or more coaches along with page details for each selected coach; the system validates the input and creates the coach social media pages linked to the corresponding coaches and the team.",

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): The team decides not to create a team social media page and skips directly to creating player or coach social media pages. The system allows the team to proceed to Step 4 or Step 5 without creating a team page and continues the flow from the selected subsequent step.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): The team decides to create player social media pages only for a subset of available players or for none at this time. The system creates player pages only for the selected players or, if none are selected, records no new player pages and allows the team to proceed to Step 5.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 5): The team decides to create coach social media pages only for a subset of available coaches or for none at this time. The system creates coach pages only for the selected coaches or, if none are selected, records no new coach pages and allows the team to proceed to Step 6.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 6): The team chooses to review existing pages without making any changes. The system presents the current configuration, registers no updates, and allows the team to continue to Step 7.",
    "AF-5 (from Step 7): The team chooses not to assign any social media manager to a specific page and retains existing assignments. The system leaves manager assignments unchanged for that page and allows the team to proceed to Step 8."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): The team provides invalid authentication credentials. The System Authentication Service rejects the credentials, the system informs the team of the failed authentication, and the use case is terminated without granting access to social media management functions.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): The team enters invalid or incomplete data for the team social media page (such as missing required fields). The system rejects the creation request, displays validation error messages, and prompts the team to correct the data before retrying Step 3.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): The team selects players that are not associated with the team or provides invalid page details. The system rejects the invalid selections or details, informs the team about the issue, and returns the team to Step 4 to adjust the input.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 5): The team selects coaches that are not associated with the team or provides invalid page details. The system rejects the invalid selections or details, informs the team about the issue, and returns the team to Step 5 to adjust the input.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 6): The team attempts to perform an update to a social media page that violates system rules (such as exceeding allowed field lengths). The system does not apply the invalid update, displays appropriate validation messages, and returns the team to Step 6 to correct the data.",
    "EF-6 (from Step 7): The team attempts to assign a social media manager using a user account that does not have sufficient rights or does not exist. The system rejects the assignment, informs the team of the invalid selection, and returns the team to Step 7 to select valid manager accounts.",
    "EF-7 (from any step): A system error or loss of connectivity occurs while processing social media page operations. The system stops the current operation, informs the team that an error has occurred, and preserves the last consistent state of social media pages and assignments; the use case is terminated or may be restarted by the team later."
