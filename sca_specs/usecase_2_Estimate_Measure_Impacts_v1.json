  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that only the actor \"urban mobility planner\" interacts directly with this use case, as no other primary actors are referenced in the Requirement Text.",
    "It is assumed that an internal Impact Estimation Engine is responsible for computing cost, emission, and noise estimates using available data, although its internal algorithms are outside the scope of this use case.",
    "It is assumed that an Urban Mobility Data Repository exists and provides necessary baseline traffic, cost, emission, and noise-related data to support the estimations.",
    "It is assumed that the proposed measure or event has already been defined or selected in the system before the estimation request is initiated in this use case.",
    "It is assumed that the estimation results are presented in a numeric and/or graphical form that is understandable by the urban mobility planner, without defining specific visualization mechanisms.",
    "It is assumed that the estimations are indicative and may include uncertainty, but the handling and communication of uncertainty levels are outside the explicit requirements and therefore not detailed in this use case.",
    "It is assumed that the same interaction flow supports both proposed measures and event scenarios, as both are mentioned together in relation to emission and noise estimation.",
    "It is assumed that the system supports selection of a geographic or network area affected by the measure or event, because emissions and noise levels are inherently location-dependent, although the granularity of the area is not specified in the Requirement Text."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): Urban mobility planner accepts default analysis parameters suggested by the system without modification → System applies the default analysis parameters and proceeds directly to Step 3.",

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): The selected measure or event configuration is incomplete or cannot be retrieved → System notifies the urban mobility planner that the configuration is invalid or missing and requests selection of a different measure or completion of configuration, after which the flow returns to Step 1 upon successful selection.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 2): One or more analysis parameters provided or confirmed by the urban mobility planner are outside allowed ranges or inconsistent with available data → System displays validation error messages indicating the problematic parameters and prompts the urban mobility planner to correct them, then returns to Step 2 after corrections.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 3): Required cost-related data are unavailable or insufficient for cost estimation → System informs the urban mobility planner that cost estimation cannot be completed due to missing or insufficient data, logs the failure, and allows the planner to continue with Steps 4 and 5 for emission and noise estimations.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 4): Required traffic or emission-related data are unavailable or insufficient for emission estimation → System informs the urban mobility planner that emission estimation cannot be completed due to missing or insufficient data, logs the failure, and allows the planner to continue with Step 5 for noise estimation and proceed to Step 6 with partial results.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 5): Required traffic or noise-related data are unavailable or insufficient for noise estimation → System informs the urban mobility planner that noise estimation cannot be completed due to missing or insufficient data, logs the failure, and allows the planner to proceed to Step 6 with the available cost and emission results.",
    "EF-6 (from Step 6): Presentation of estimation results fails due to a system error → System displays an error message, records the error for diagnostic purposes, and keeps any successfully computed estimation data stored for later retrieval once the issue is resolved."
