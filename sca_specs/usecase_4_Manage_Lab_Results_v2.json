  "description": "The use case defines how a patient accesses the Digital Medical Record System, navigates to their medical record, locates their lab test results, and views the detailed information for one or more lab tests that have already been linked to their medical record.",
  "triggering_event": "A patient decides to access the Digital Medical Record System to review their lab test results.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The patient has an active user account in the Digital Medical Record System.",
    "The patient is successfully authenticated in the Digital Medical Record System using the supported login mechanism.",
    "The patient has an existing medical record in the Digital Medical Record System.",
    "At least one lab test result for the patient has been uploaded by a lab specialist and linked to the patient’s medical record via the included \"order medical tests\" and \"access medical records\" related functionality."

  "postconditions": [
    "The patient has accessed their medical record within the Digital Medical Record System.",
    "The patient has viewed a list of their available lab test results associated with their medical record.",
    "The patient has viewed the detailed information for at least one selected lab test result.",
    "The system has recorded, if supported, that the patient viewed the selected lab test result during the session.",
    "The patient can end the session having successfully reviewed their lab test result information."

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the ordering of medical tests by doctors and the production of corresponding lab results are completed before the patient attempts to view any lab test results.",
    "It is assumed that lab specialists have already uploaded lab test results and linked them to the correct patient medical records using the separate laboratory workflows associated with the \"order medical tests\" use case.",
    "It is assumed that the retrieval of patient medical record content, including lab test results, is handled through functionality conceptually associated with the \"access medical records\" use case, which is invoked during this flow.",
    "It is assumed that the patient has the necessary authorization to view lab test results that are linked to their own medical record.",
    "It is assumed that the Digital Medical Record System provides a user interface for patients to navigate to their medical record and to access a section where lab test results are listed and can be opened for detailed viewing.",
    "It is assumed that the visibility policy for showing lab test results to patients allows the results considered in this use case to be displayed once they are stored and linked.",
    "It is assumed that this use case does not modify or define how lab test results are created, uploaded, or edited by lab specialists; it only describes patient viewing behavior.",
    "It is assumed that the system supports access from multiple device types (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, computers) but that this use case flow is independent of the specific device used."

    "The policy governing when lab test results become visible to the patient (immediately upon upload or only after review by a doctor) is not specified.",

    "The need for additional explanations or layman-friendly descriptions of lab test result values for patients is not clarified.",

    "The retention period and archival behavior for lab test results within the patient-facing view of the medical record are not defined."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Patient initiates access to the Digital Medical Record System from a supported device → System displays the login interface for user authentication.",
    "2. Patient provides valid authentication credentials and submits the login request → System verifies the credentials and establishes an authenticated session for the patient.",
    "3. Patient selects the option to open their medical record → System invokes the included \"access medical records\" functionality and retrieves the patient’s medical record overview.",
    "4. Patient navigates to the section for lab test results within their medical record → System displays a list of lab test results associated with the patient’s medical record, including basic identifying information for each test.",
    "5. Patient reviews the list of lab test results and selects a specific lab test result to view in detail → System retrieves the detailed information for the selected lab test result from the stored laboratory data.",
    "6. System presents the detailed view of the selected lab test result to the patient → System displays the lab test result values, associated test identifiers, dates, and any stored explanatory notes in a readable format.",
    "7. Patient reviews the detailed lab test result information → System maintains the display of the selected lab test result and, if supported, may record that the patient has viewed this result.",
    "8. Patient chooses to return to the lab test results list or exit the medical record view → System either redisplays the list of lab test results as in Step 4 or navigates back to the main area of the patient’s account.",
    "9. Patient ends the session by logging out or closing the application → System terminates the authenticated session and confirms that access to the medical record, including lab test results, is closed for that session."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 4): Patient filters or sorts the list of lab test results. Condition: The patient wants to locate specific lab tests (for example, by date range or test type). The patient applies filter or sort options on the displayed list. The system updates the lab test results list display according to the chosen filter or sort criteria. The flow then continues at Step 5 when the patient selects a specific lab test result to view in detail.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): Patient chooses to view multiple lab test results sequentially. Condition: The patient wants to compare several lab test results. After viewing the detailed information for the currently selected lab test result, the patient uses navigation controls to move directly to the next or previous lab test result without returning to the list. The system retrieves and displays the detailed information for the next or previous lab test result as requested. The flow continues at Step 7 for each displayed result, and the patient may return to the list as in Step 8 at any time.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): Patient navigates to another section of the medical record instead of ending the session. Condition: The patient wishes to continue reviewing other parts of their medical record after viewing lab test results. From the lab test results list or detail page, the patient selects a navigation option to another section of the medical record. The system displays the selected section of the medical record while keeping the authenticated session active. The patient may later return to Step 4 to view lab test results again or proceed to Step 9 to end the session."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): Authentication fails. Condition: The patient provides invalid or incomplete login credentials. The system rejects the login attempt, displays an appropriate error message, and prompts the patient to re-enter credentials. The flow returns to Step 2 for another attempt. If the patient stops attempting to log in, the use case ends without any lab test results being viewed.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): No lab test results are available for the patient. Condition: The patient’s medical record currently has no linked lab test results. The system informs the patient that no lab test results are available and does not display a lab test results list. The patient may navigate to other sections of the medical record or end the session, and the use case ends without any lab test result being viewed.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 5): The system cannot retrieve the selected lab test result details. Condition: A technical error or data issue prevents retrieval of the selected lab test result. The system displays an error message indicating that the selected lab test result cannot be shown and returns the patient to the lab test results list as in Step 4. The patient may select another lab test result or end the session.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 9): Session ends unexpectedly. Condition: Network failure, timeout, or unexpected closure of the application occurs before the patient explicitly logs out. The system terminates the session and stops displaying any medical record information. The use case ends without further interaction, and the patient must restart from Step 1 to view lab test results again."
