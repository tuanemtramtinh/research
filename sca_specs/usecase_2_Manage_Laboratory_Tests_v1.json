  "description": "The use case describes how a laboratory technician views pending laboratory tests, reviews their details and urgency, receives notifications of new test requests, and enters test results into the system for doctors to review.",
  "triggering_event": "A laboratory technician signs in and chooses to manage laboratory tests in order to process assigned test work.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The laboratory technician has a valid user account in the system.",
    "The laboratory technician is authenticated in the system according to configured security policies.",
    "Laboratory test requests created by doctors are recorded and stored in the system.",
    "The system has access to information about the doctor who requested each laboratory test.",

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that only one generic \"Healthcare Information System\" exists as the system boundary handling laboratory tests, and that external laboratory equipment or devices are outside the scope of this use case.",
    "It is assumed that doctors are the only role that creates laboratory test requests that appear in the laboratory technician’s overview, because the requirement text mentions only doctors as requesters for tests.",
    "It is assumed that the system maintains a status for each laboratory test (for example, pending or completed), and that tests shown in the overview are those that still need to be performed.",
    "It is assumed that details shown for a laboratory test include at least the type of test, the urgency level, and identification of the requesting doctor, as explicitly required by the user story.",
    "It is assumed that the system supports some form of notification mechanism to inform laboratory technicians when new test requests are created, without specifying the notification channel (for example, in-application alerts or equivalent).",
    "It is assumed that entering test results in this use case refers only to manual entry of results by the laboratory technician via the system user interface and does not imply any direct device integration.",
    "It is assumed that access control policies are configured elsewhere in the system so that laboratory technicians can only access those laboratory tests they are authorized to see.",
    "It is assumed that the laboratory technician can repeatedly refresh or reopen the overview of tests within a single execution of this use case, but at least one successful view of the pending tests occurs.",
    "It is assumed that the system logs the association between a test result and the laboratory technician who entered it for auditability, even though this logging is not explicitly mentioned in the requirement text.",
    "It is assumed that error handling for invalid or incomplete test results is addressed in this and other related exception flows, and does not require additional system functions beyond those implied by validating entered data."

  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. Laboratory technician selects the option to manage laboratory tests in the system → System displays the laboratory test management workspace.",
    "2. Laboratory technician requests to view all laboratory tests that need to be performed → System retrieves and displays an overview list of pending laboratory tests assigned or visible to the laboratory technician.",
    "3. Laboratory technician reviews the overview of pending laboratory tests → System presents for each test at least the test identifier, test type, urgency level, and the name or identifier of the requesting doctor.",
    "4. Laboratory technician selects a specific pending laboratory test from the overview to inspect its details → System displays detailed information for the selected laboratory test, including test type, urgency, requesting doctor, and any additional available instructions.",
    "5. Laboratory technician decides to process the selected laboratory test and prepares to enter the corresponding test results → System presents an input form or equivalent interface for entering the results associated with the selected laboratory test.",
    "6. Laboratory technician enters the laboratory test results into the system and confirms the entry → System validates the entered test results according to basic data consistency rules and stores the results linked to the corresponding laboratory test request.",
    "7. Laboratory technician completes the processing of the laboratory test in the system → System updates the status of the laboratory test to indicate that results have been entered, removes or reclassifies it from the list of pending tests, and makes the stored results available for review by the requesting doctor.",
    "8. Laboratory technician remains in the laboratory test management workspace to continue monitoring and handling additional laboratory tests → System continues to monitor for new laboratory test requests and, according to configured notification rules, generates notifications for the laboratory technician when new test requests become available."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): Laboratory technician filters or sorts the overview of pending laboratory tests. Condition: The laboratory technician wants to focus on a subset of tests (for example, by urgency or requesting doctor). Flow: From the overview screen, the laboratory technician applies filter or sorting options to the list of pending laboratory tests → System reapplies the requested filter or sorting criteria and refreshes the overview to show the updated list. The flow then continues with Step 3 using the filtered or sorted overview.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): Laboratory technician chooses to review detailed information of multiple tests before entering any results. Condition: The laboratory technician wishes to plan work by reviewing several test details in sequence. Flow: After viewing the details of one test in Step 4, the laboratory technician returns to the overview and selects another pending laboratory test → System displays the detailed information of the newly selected test. The laboratory technician may repeat this review cycle multiple times, after which the flow continues with Step 5 for the test chosen for result entry.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 6): Laboratory technician saves partially completed test result data as a draft. Condition: The laboratory technician cannot complete all test measurements at once but wants to preserve entered information. Flow: Instead of final confirmation, the laboratory technician chooses to save the current entry as an intermediate state → System validates the provided partial data to the extent possible, stores it as a draft linked to the laboratory test, and keeps the test in a state where it still appears in the list of tests that need to be completed. The flow may later resume at Step 5 or Step 6 when the laboratory technician is ready to finalize the results.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 8): New laboratory test requests arrive while the laboratory technician is viewing the overview. Condition: Additional tests are requested by doctors during the ongoing session. Flow: While the laboratory technician is in the laboratory test management workspace, new test requests are recorded by the system → System generates one or more notifications according to configured rules and offers an option to refresh the overview list; when the laboratory technician refreshes or acknowledges, the system updates the overview in Step 2 to include the newly requested tests, and the flow proceeds with Step 3."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): Failure to load pending laboratory tests. Condition: A system error or data access problem prevents retrieval of the list of pending laboratory tests. Flow: System fails to retrieve the pending tests → System displays an error message indicating that the overview cannot be loaded and logs the error for technical investigation. The use case terminates for the current attempt; the laboratory technician may retry starting from the triggering event once the issue is resolved.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): Selected laboratory test is no longer available or accessible. Condition: The laboratory technician selects a test that has just been completed, cancelled, or is otherwise no longer accessible. Flow: Laboratory technician selects the test → System detects that the selected laboratory test is not in a valid state for processing and does not display the details; instead, it shows an explanatory message and refreshes the overview to reflect the current set of pending tests. The flow resumes at Step 3 with the updated overview.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 6): Entered laboratory test results fail validation. Condition: The laboratory technician enters results that violate data consistency rules (for example, missing required fields or values outside allowed formats). Flow: Laboratory technician confirms the entry → System validates the entered results, detects validation errors, does not store the invalid data as final results, and displays clear error messages indicating which fields require correction while preserving the entered values where possible. The flow returns to Step 6 for corrected data entry.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 8): Notification mechanism for new laboratory test requests fails. Condition: The system cannot generate or deliver notifications for new test requests due to an internal error. Flow: New test requests are recorded while the laboratory technician is in the management workspace → System fails to send or display the configured notifications and logs the error; the laboratory technician can still obtain the updated list of pending tests by reloading the overview manually in Step 2. The use case continues without automated notifications but the technician may experience delayed awareness of incoming tests."
