  "description": "This use case describes how a systems analyst views anonymized clinical and operational data made available by the hospital management system, including clinical data, bed occupancy data, room scheduling data, and employee schedule data, by applying filters and queries so that the data can be used for prescriptive and predictive analytics. The use case invokes existing medical data management capabilities as an included function when the system retrieves and prepares clinical data for analytic viewing.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Systems analyst selects the anonymized data analytics function in the hospital management system → System verifies the analyst’s authorization level and displays the analytics workspace with available anonymized data categories (clinical data, bed occupancy, room scheduling, employee schedules).",
    "2. Systems analyst chooses to view anonymized clinical data for analysis → System invokes the included \"manage medical data\" functionality in read-only mode to retrieve relevant clinical records from the central electronic medical records and prepares them for anonymized display.",
    "3. Systems analyst specifies analytic parameters for clinical data, such as time range, clinical variables, or patient population characteristics (without direct identifiers) → System applies the specified parameters to the anonymized clinical data set and generates a filtered and aggregated view suitable for analysis.",
    "4. Systems analyst chooses to view anonymized bed occupancy data → System retrieves bed occupancy data from the central database, applies configured anonymization and privacy rules, and prepares the data for analytic display.",
    "5. Systems analyst specifies analytic parameters for bed occupancy data, such as date range, wards, or capacity thresholds → System applies the specified parameters and generates a filtered and aggregated bed occupancy view.",
    "6. Systems analyst chooses to view anonymized room scheduling data → System retrieves room scheduling data from the central database, applies configured anonymization and privacy rules, and prepares the data for analytic display.",
    "7. Systems analyst specifies analytic parameters for room scheduling data, such as date range, room types, or procedure categories → System applies the specified parameters and generates a filtered and aggregated room scheduling view.",
    "8. Systems analyst chooses to view anonymized employee schedule data → System retrieves employee schedule data from the central database, applies configured anonymization and privacy rules, and prepares the data for analytic display.",
    "9. Systems analyst specifies analytic parameters for employee schedule data, such as date range, departments, or staff roles → System applies the specified parameters and generates a filtered and aggregated employee schedule view.",
    "10. Systems analyst reviews the anonymized analytic views for clinical, occupancy, scheduling, and staffing data on dashboards or reports → System presents the requested anonymized data views in tabular and/or graphical formats and maintains internal logs of the viewing session."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): Systems analyst decides to restrict the anonymized clinical data view to a narrower subset after the initial retrieval (for example, a specific department or diagnosis-related group) → System updates the applied filters on the anonymized clinical data and refreshes the analytic view before the flow continues with Step 3.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): Systems analyst chooses to analyze bed occupancy for only a subset of wards or time intervals before specifying detailed parameters → System limits the available bed occupancy data to the chosen subset and then proceeds with Step 5.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 6): Systems analyst opts to view room scheduling data aggregated by room type rather than by individual room → System aggregates the anonymized room scheduling data by room type and then continues with Step 7.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 8): Systems analyst chooses to view employee schedule data at department level rather than individual staff level to further reduce identifiability → System aggregates the anonymized employee schedule data at department level and then proceeds with Step 9."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): The system determines that the user does not have the required systems analyst role or access level → System denies access to the analytics workspace, displays an authorization error message, logs the attempt, and returns the user to the main menu.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 2): The system encounters an error while retrieving clinical data from the electronic medical records (for example, database unavailable) → System displays an error message indicating that clinical data cannot be loaded, logs the failure, and allows the systems analyst to select a different data category or end the session.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): The system cannot retrieve bed occupancy data due to data source unavailability → System displays an error message indicating that bed occupancy data is temporarily unavailable, logs the failure, and allows the systems analyst to work with other available data categories or end the session.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 6): The system cannot retrieve room scheduling data due to a data access or integrity issue → System displays an error message, logs the issue, and allows the systems analyst to select other data categories or end the session.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 8): The system cannot retrieve employee schedule data due to a data access or integrity issue → System displays an error message, logs the issue, and allows the systems analyst to work with other available data categories or end the session.",
    "EF-6 (from any data retrieval step 2, 4, 6, or 8): The system detects that configured anonymization rules cannot be applied correctly to the requested data (for example, configuration error) → System does not display the affected data, informs the systems analyst that the data cannot be shown due to privacy configuration problems, logs the incident, and terminates the viewing of that specific data category while keeping the session active for other categories."
