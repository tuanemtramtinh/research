    "4. IFA confirms the integration configuration for the selected existing systems → System applies the integration configuration and stores integration settings for subsequent data access.",
    "5. IFA selects the language support configuration section → System displays the list of languages that can be enabled within the system.",
    "6. IFA selects one or more languages to be supported and, if applicable, sets a default system language → System validates the language selections and updates the language configuration preview.",
    "7. IFA confirms the language support configuration → System applies the language configuration, stores it, and prepares user-facing components to use the configured language options.",
    "8. IFA selects the reliability configuration section related to concurrent user capacity → System displays configuration parameters relevant to supporting at least 50,000 concurrent users, according to existing capabilities.",

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): IFA configures only a subset of available existing systems for integration. Condition: The IFA decides not to integrate all listed existing systems. The IFA selects only certain existing systems and provides connection and data mapping parameters for this subset. The system validates only the selected integrations, shows the configured subset, and the flow continues with Step 4.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): IFA enables only a single language for the system. Condition: The IFA chooses to operate the system in one language at this time. The IFA selects a single language and designates it as the default. The system validates the configuration, updates the language configuration preview accordingly, and the flow continues with Step 7.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 9): IFA accepts recommended default reliability configuration. Condition: The system presents a default configuration that the IFA deems sufficient for supporting at least 50,000 concurrent users. The IFA reviews but does not change the recommended reliability parameters. The system confirms that the default parameters meet the predefined target and the flow continues with Step 10."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): Integration parameter validation fails. Condition: One or more connection or data mapping parameters specified for an existing system are invalid according to system rules. The system rejects the invalid entries, displays error messages indicating which parameters are incorrect, and requests corrected values. The use case continues when the IFA provides valid parameters and the system successfully validates them, after which the flow proceeds with Step 4. If the IFA chooses to cancel the configuration, the system discards unsaved integration changes and the use case ends without applying new integration settings.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 6): Selected language is not supported by the system. Condition: The IFA attempts to select a language that is not in the list of supported languages. The system rejects the unsupported language selection, informs the IFA that the language cannot be enabled, and prompts the IFA to select from supported languages. The use case continues when the IFA selects only supported languages and the system validates the configuration, after which the flow proceeds with Step 7.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 9): Reliability configuration parameters exceed allowed limits. Condition: The IFA specifies reliability-related parameters that are outside the permitted range or conflict with existing capacity constraints. The system rejects the excessive or inconsistent settings, displays explanatory messages, and requests that the IFA adjust the parameters to within allowable bounds. The use case continues when the IFA provides acceptable parameters and the system validates them, after which the flow proceeds with Step 10.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 10): Failure to persist configuration changes. Condition: A system or storage error occurs while saving the new infrastructure configuration. The system notifies the IFA that configuration changes could not be saved, logs the failure according to existing logging mechanisms, and retains the previous configuration as active. The use case ends with no new configuration applied."
