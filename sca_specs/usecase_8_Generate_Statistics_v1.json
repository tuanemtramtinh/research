  "description": "This use case describes how the IFA League Management System derives and maintains player and match statistics automatically from match event data that has been reported into the system, ensuring that statistics remain consistent with official match records and do not require extra manual processing by the IFA.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA requests that the system generate or refresh player and match statistics based on the set of match events already reported into the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA League Management System is operational and accessible to the IFA.",
    "Relevant match events have been reported into the system by authorized match officials or pre-existing reporting mechanisms.",
    "The IFA is authenticated in the system with sufficient privileges to view and request statistics.",
    "League rules and data structures necessary to interpret match events into statistics are configured in the system."

    "The IFA can access the generated statistics without performing additional manual data processing."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that reported match events already exist in the system before the IFA initiates the generation of statistics, because the requirement specifies derivation \"directly from reported match events\".",
    "It is assumed that only match events originating from authorized match officials or designated official sources are treated as valid inputs for statistics, in line with the goal to rely on official data and prevent unauthorized data sources being relevant.",
    "It is assumed that the system has predefined mappings between types of match events and the statistics that must be updated (for example, goals, cards and substitutions), because statistics are to be derived automatically without additional work by the IFA.",
    "It is assumed that the IFA can select a scope (such as competition, league, team, player or time period) for which statistics will be generated, as this is necessary to produce meaningful statistics while not adding new functional capabilities beyond statistics derivation.",
    "It is assumed that statistics generation may be requested on demand by the IFA and, in addition, may be triggered internally by the system when new match events are recorded, although only the externally requested generation is described in the main flow.",
    "It is assumed that any necessary validation and correction of match event data is handled by other use cases, and that this use case only operates on match events that the system has already accepted as valid.",
    "It is assumed that statistics are generated using the league rules currently in effect for the relevant competition, since the correctness of derived statistics depends on those rules."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. ifa requests generation of player and match statistics for a specified scope (such as league, competition, team, player or time period) → System accepts the request and records the selected scope and parameters for statistics generation.",
    "2. ifa confirms that the generation shall be based only on previously reported match events → System validates that match event data exist for the requested scope and identifies the relevant match events.",
    "3. ifa waits while statistics are derived → System interprets the identified match events using the configured league rules and maps them to predefined statistical metrics for players and matches.",
    "4. ifa continues to wait while processing completes → System calculates and aggregates player statistics for the requested scope based on the interpreted match events.",
    "5. ifa continues to wait while processing completes → System calculates and aggregates match statistics for the requested scope based on the interpreted match events.",
    "6. ifa requests to view the generated statistics → System stores the generated player and match statistics persistently and associates them with the corresponding players, teams, matches and competitions.",
    "7. ifa reviews the presented statistics → System presents the generated player and match statistics for the requested scope to the ifa in a readable format."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 1): ifa chooses a narrower scope such as a single team or player instead of a broader league or competition when requesting statistics generation → System records the more specific scope, proceeds with identification of relevant match events for that team or player, and then continues with Step 2.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): ifa requests export or summary viewing only for aggregated statistics (for example, season-level aggregates) instead of detailed per-match statistics → System generates the same statistics internally but presents them in aggregated form while underlying detailed statistics remain stored; the flow then completes as in Step 7."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): System determines that there are no reported match events for the requested scope → System informs the ifa that statistics cannot be generated because no relevant match events are available, logs the incident, and terminates the use case without creating or updating statistics.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): System encounters inconsistent or unreadable match event data during interpretation → System stops the statistics generation process for the affected scope, records an error related to the problematic events, notifies the ifa that statistics generation failed due to data issues, and leaves previously existing statistics unchanged.",
    "EF-3 (from Steps 4 or 5): System experiences a processing failure or resource issue while calculating statistics → System aborts the current statistics generation request, logs the failure, notifies the ifa that the operation was not completed successfully, and does not commit partial statistics results."
