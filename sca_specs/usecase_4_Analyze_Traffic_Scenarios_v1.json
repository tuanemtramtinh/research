  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): Urban mobility planner starts with crisis simulation. Condition: The planner chooses to simulate a traffic crisis before viewing any historical situation. The planner selects the crisis simulation option on the initial analysis screen. The system bypasses Steps 3–5 and proceeds directly to display the crisis simulation configuration interface as described in Step 6, then continues with Steps 7–9 and ends successfully.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 3): Historical time range refinement. Condition: The urban mobility planner wishes to refine the initially selected time range. After the system validates the initial date and time range, the planner adjusts the time range or area of interest. The system revalidates the updated selection and, upon success, continues with Step 4 and the flow ends successfully.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): Use of default crisis parameters. Condition: The urban mobility planner accepts all default crisis simulation parameters. The planner directly confirms the simulation request without changing any values. The system validates the default parameters as complete and feasible and then proceeds directly to Step 8 and completes the flow successfully."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): Selected historical period has no data. Condition: The system determines that no historical traffic data exists for the selected date, time range, or area. The system displays an error message indicating that the selected period is unsupported and prompts the urban mobility planner to choose another date or adjust the time range. The flow returns to Step 3 upon a new selection; if the planner cancels, the use case ends without displaying historical traffic situations.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 7): Invalid or infeasible crisis simulation parameters. Condition: The system detects that one or more configured crisis simulation parameters are invalid or infeasible (for example, time frame outside simulation horizon or area outside the modeled network). The system informs the urban mobility planner of the invalid parameters and highlights the fields requiring correction. The flow returns to Step 7 for parameter correction; if the planner cancels, the use case ends without running a simulation.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 8): Simulation execution failure. Condition: The crisis simulation cannot be completed due to internal processing errors or resource limitations. The system logs the error, notifies the urban mobility planner that the simulation has failed, and advises retrying later or reducing scenario size. The use case ends without presenting crisis simulation results.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 4): Historical data retrieval failure. Condition: The system encounters an error while retrieving historical traffic data for the requested period. The system logs the error, displays a notification that historical data cannot be loaded for the selected period, and offers the urban mobility planner the option to select another period. If the planner selects another period, the flow returns to Step 3; otherwise, the use case ends without displaying historical traffic situations."
