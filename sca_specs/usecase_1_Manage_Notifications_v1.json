  "description": "This use case describes how the system allows the IFA to initiate notifications for game events and schedule changes and how the system configures, applies, and respects stakeholder notification preferences when delivering notifications to fans and match officials.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA initiates the notification process for a game event or schedule change that must be communicated to stakeholders.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA League Management System is operational and connected to the Notification Delivery Service.",
    "The fan has an active user account within the system.",
    "The match official has an active user account within the system.",
    "The IFA user initiating the notification is authenticated and authorized to manage notifications for game events.",
    "The relevant game and game event or schedule change exist and are recorded in the system."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "Stakeholders selected by the IFA have corresponding notification records stored in the system for the specified game event or schedule change.",
    "Notifications for the specified game event or schedule change have been issued to all targeted stakeholders according to their stored notification preferences and IFA configuration.",
    "The system maintains an auditable record that the notification process was executed for the specified game event or schedule change."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "The Notification Delivery Service is an external supporting service responsible only for physical delivery of notifications via channels predefined by the system and does not introduce new functional requirements.",
    "Stakeholders (fans and match officials) have already registered their contact information and at least one notification channel that the system can use for delivery.",
    "Fans can configure which types of game events they wish to be notified about, and this configuration is stored as notification preferences within the system.",
    "Match officials receive all schedule-related notifications relevant to their assigned games and do not configure granular notification event-type preferences in this use case.",
    "The IFA defines which game events are considered important and must be notifiable, and such definitions are already configured as part of system master data.",
    "The system determines the relevant stakeholders for a game event based on existing assignments and relationships (for example, fans following a team or match, and match officials assigned to a match) that are maintained elsewhere in the system.",
    "Simultaneous notification in this context means that the system initiates delivery requests to all relevant stakeholders within a single operation without intentional ordering differences between stakeholder groups.",
    "The phrase 'as soon as possible' is interpreted as the system initiating notifications immediately after the IFA confirms the notification action, subject to technical processing time.",
    "Stakeholder notification preferences do not override mandatory notifications defined by IFA policies; such mandatory notifications are outside the scope of this use case and are assumed configured.",
    "Only the actors listed in the input (fan, ifa, match official) interact directly with this use case; other organizational roles mentioned in the Requirement Text are not involved in Manage Notifications."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow a fan to receive notifications about important schedule changes, such as delayed kick-offs, so that the fan can plan accordingly.",
    "The system shall allow a match official to receive notifications about important schedule changes, such as delayed kick-offs, so that the match official can plan accordingly.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to notify all stakeholders of a selected game event in a single operation so that stakeholders are notified simultaneously and in the same manner.",
    "The system shall allow a fan to select which types of game events they wish to be notified about so that the fan can limit the number of notifications received.",
    "The system shall apply stored fan notification preferences when determining whether to send a notification for a particular game event or schedule change.",
    "The system shall determine the relevant stakeholders for a given game event or schedule change based on existing relationships and assignments recorded in the system.",
    "The system shall initiate sending notifications to all targeted stakeholders immediately after the IFA confirms that notifications should be issued for a game event or schedule change.",

  "risk": "Medium",
  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The policy for which specific game event types are considered important and thus notifiable has not been specified and must be defined by the IFA.",
    "The set of notification delivery channels to be supported by the system (for example, mobile push, email, SMS) is not defined and must be clarified.",
    "The conflict resolution rule between IFA-mandated notifications and user-specific notification preferences is not explicitly defined and must be confirmed.",
    "The maximum acceptable delay between a schedule change being recorded and notifications being delivered to stakeholders has not been specified and requires a performance requirement.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. ifa → System presents an authenticated IFA user interface for managing notifications for games and game events.",
    "2. ifa → System allows the IFA to search for and select a specific game for which a notification is to be managed.",
    "3. ifa → System displays game details, including available game events and schedule change indicators for the selected game.",
    "4. ifa → System allows the IFA to select a game event or schedule change that should trigger notifications to stakeholders.",
    "5. ifa → System determines the set of relevant stakeholders for the selected game event or schedule change based on existing assignments and relationships.",
    "6. System → System retrieves stored notification preferences for each relevant fan stakeholder.",
    "7. System → System compiles a list of targeted stakeholders by applying fan notification preferences and including all match officials relevant to the game.",
    "8. System → System prepares a standardized notification message for the selected game event or schedule change according to IFA configuration.",
    "9. ifa → System displays a summary of the game event or schedule change, the targeted stakeholders, and the notification message for IFA confirmation.",
    "10. ifa → System receives the IFA confirmation to send notifications for the selected game event or schedule change.",
    "11. System → System initiates notification delivery requests via the Notification Delivery Service to all targeted stakeholders in a single operation.",
    "12. System → System records that notifications were generated and initiated for the selected game event or schedule change and confirms successful initiation to the IFA.",
    "13. fan → System provides an interface for the fan to view and manage notification preferences for game events.",
    "14. fan → System receives and stores the fan's selected notification preferences for future use in notification targeting."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 4): If the IFA selects a game event or schedule change that has already had notifications sent previously, the system displays an informational message indicating that notifications were previously initiated and still proceeds with Step 5 to allow additional notifications if the IFA confirms in Step 10.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 7): If there are no fan stakeholders matching the notification criteria but there are match officials assigned to the game, the system compiles a targeted stakeholder list containing only the relevant match officials and then continues with Step 8.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): If there are fan stakeholders but all have configured preferences that exclude the selected game event type, the system compiles a targeted stakeholder list that excludes fans and includes only required stakeholders such as match officials, then continues with Step 8.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 13): If the fan updates notification preferences multiple times in a single session, the system overwrites previously stored preferences with the latest confirmed values and confirms the update while still ending with Step 14."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): If the system cannot find the game identified by the IFA due to invalid search criteria or missing data, the system informs the IFA that the game cannot be located and prompts the IFA to adjust the search; the main flow is resumed from Step 2 after the IFA provides new search criteria.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 10): If the IFA cancels the notification operation instead of confirming, the system aborts the notification process, does not send any notifications, records the cancellation event, and returns the IFA to the game details view, ending the use case for that notification attempt.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 11): If the Notification Delivery Service is unavailable or returns an error for all delivery requests, the system marks the notification batch as failed, logs the failure, informs the IFA that notifications could not be delivered, and halts further notification attempts within this execution of the use case.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 11): If the Notification Delivery Service partially delivers notifications and reports failures for some stakeholders, the system records which deliveries failed, informs the IFA about partial delivery results, and completes the use case with a partially delivered state.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 14): If the system cannot persist the fan's updated notification preferences due to a storage error, the system displays an error message to the fan, discards the attempted changes, and retains the previously stored preferences, after which the fan may attempt to update preferences again starting from Step 13."
