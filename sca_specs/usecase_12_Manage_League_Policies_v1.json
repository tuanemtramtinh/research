    "IFA: Requires centralized control over league policies and seasonal budget policies to ensure games and financial operations follow official regulations.",
    "Leagues: Require clear and up-to-date policies that determine how games are run within each league.",
    "Teams: Require transparent and consistent budget policy specifications per season to plan and report finances in line with IFA regulations.",
    "Referees: Require stable league policies that affect how games are conducted and officiated.",
    "Fans: Require games to run consistently and fairly under well-defined policies.",
    "System Administrator: Requires that policy management operations are secure, auditable, and do not compromise system stability."

  "description": "This use case allows the IFA to securely define and update league-level policies and seasonal budget policies that govern how games are run and how financial regulations are specified within the system.",
  "triggering_event": "The IFA decides to define or change league policies or to define a seasonal budget policy using the system.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA has valid access credentials registered in the system.",
    "The IFA has the necessary authorization role to manage league and budget policies.",
    "The league entities targeted for policy definition or change exist in the system.",
    "The season for which a budget policy is to be defined exists or can be selected in the system."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "The specified league policies are stored in the system in their latest defined or updated form.",
    "The specified seasonal budget policy is stored in the system in its latest defined form.",
    "The system associates the stored policies with the relevant leagues and seasons for subsequent enforcement by other system functions.",
    "An audit record of the IFA’s policy management actions is stored, including time, actor, and type of change."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "The 'authenticate' included relationship refers to an existing authentication function that verifies IFA credentials before policy management is allowed.",
    "Only the IFA actor is authorized to manage league policies and seasonal budget policies within the system.",
    "League policies and seasonal budget policies are represented as structured policy data that can be entered, reviewed, and confirmed by the IFA through the system.",
    "The system already maintains master data for leagues and seasons, enabling the IFA to select the appropriate league and season when defining or changing policies.",
    "Other use cases in the system are responsible for enforcing the defined policies during game management, budgeting, and scheduling, and this use case only manages policy definitions and updates.",
    "The IFA performs policy changes intentionally and understands the external implications; the system’s responsibility is limited to secure capture, validation, storage, and presentation of policy data."

  "requirements_met": [
    "The system shall allow the IFA to define policies of the leagues in order to control how games run.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to change existing policies of the leagues in order to control how games run.",
    "The system shall allow the IFA to define budget policy per season in order to maintain authority over the specifications of budgets.",
    "The system shall require successful authentication of the IFA before granting access to league and budget policy management functions.",
    "The system shall store each defined or updated league policy and associate it with the selected league.",
    "The system shall store each defined seasonal budget policy and associate it with the selected season.",
    "The system shall display the current league policies and seasonal budget policies to the IFA for review before confirmation.",

  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The precise structure and attributes of league policies (e.g., disciplinary rules, game format, point system) have not been specified.",

  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. IFA initiates policy management by requesting access to the league and budget policy functions → System invokes the authentication service to verify the IFA's identity and authorization.",
    "2. IFA provides authentication credentials as requested → System validates the credentials via the authentication service and grants access to the policy management area upon successful verification.",
    "3. IFA selects the option to manage league policies → System displays a list of leagues and the currently stored policies for the selected league, if any.",
    "4. IFA selects a specific league for policy management → System retrieves and displays the existing league policies associated with the selected league, or indicates that no policies are currently defined.",
    "5. IFA chooses to define new league policies or update existing league policies and enters or modifies the policy details → System captures the entered league policy data and presents a consolidated review view to the IFA.",
    "6. IFA reviews the league policy data and confirms the definition or change → System validates the league policy data according to predefined validation rules and, if valid, stores the updated league policies associated with the selected league.",
    "7. IFA selects the option to manage seasonal budget policies → System displays available seasons and any existing seasonal budget policy associated with the selected season.",
    "8. IFA selects a specific season for budget policy definition → System retrieves and displays the existing seasonal budget policy for the selected season, or indicates that no budget policy is currently defined.",
    "9. IFA enters or updates the seasonal budget policy details for the selected season → System captures the entered seasonal budget policy data and presents a consolidated review view to the IFA.",
    "10. IFA reviews the seasonal budget policy data and confirms the definition → System validates the seasonal budget policy data according to predefined validation rules and, if valid, stores the seasonal budget policy associated with the selected season.",
    "11. IFA ends the session or navigates away from policy management → System finalizes the session, ensures that all committed policy changes are persistently stored, and records audit entries for the performed policy operations."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): IFA chooses to manage only seasonal budget policies without first managing league policies. Condition: IFA does not intend to view or change league policies in this session. Flow: From Step 3, instead of selecting the option to manage league policies, the IFA directly selects the option to manage seasonal budget policies. The system then proceeds with Steps 7 to 11 for seasonal budget policy management and completes the use case successfully.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 7): IFA chooses to manage only league policies without managing seasonal budget policies. Condition: IFA does not intend to view or define seasonal budget policies in this session. Flow: After completing league policy confirmation in Step 6, the IFA decides not to proceed with seasonal budget policy management. The IFA ends the session, and the system proceeds directly to Step 11, finalizing storage and audit for league policy changes only."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): Authentication failure. Condition: The IFA provides invalid or unauthorized credentials. Flow: The system rejects the authentication attempt, informs the IFA that access is denied due to invalid credentials, and does not display any policy management functions. The use case terminates without any change to league or budget policies.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 6): League policy validation failure. Condition: The entered league policy data does not satisfy the system’s validation rules. Flow: The system does not store the proposed policy changes, highlights the validation errors to the IFA, and prompts for correction. The IFA may correct the data and repeat Step 5 and Step 6. If the IFA abandons the changes, the system discards the unconfirmed data and retains the previously stored league policies, and the use case continues or ends without modifying league policies.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 10): Seasonal budget policy validation failure. Condition: The entered seasonal budget policy data does not satisfy the system’s validation rules. Flow: The system does not store the proposed budget policy, highlights the validation errors to the IFA, and prompts for correction. The IFA may correct the data and repeat Step 9 and Step 10. If the IFA abandons the changes, the system discards the unconfirmed data and retains any previously stored seasonal budget policy for that season, and the use case continues or ends without modifying the seasonal budget policy.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 11): Storage or audit persistence error. Condition: The system encounters a failure while persisting policy data or writing audit records. Flow: The system logs the technical error, informs the IFA that the operation could not be fully completed, and indicates which policy changes may not have been saved. The system prevents partial, inconsistent updates by rolling back affected policy changes where possible. The use case terminates after error notification."
