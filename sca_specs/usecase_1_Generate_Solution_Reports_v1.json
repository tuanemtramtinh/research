  "description": "This use case describes how an urban mobility planner generates executive summary reports and extensive detailed reports describing the consequences of mobility solutions, in order to inform recipients such as the mayor and consultancy companies.",

  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The urban mobility planner is authenticated and authorized to access the Urban Mobility Planning Decision Support System.",
    "At least one mobility solution proposal has been defined in the system.",
    "Relevant analysis results and solution consequences for the selected mobility solution proposal are already available within the system.",
    "The system has access to the stored data describing the selected mobility solution and its consequences."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "An executive summary report describing the consequences of the selected mobility solution has been generated and is available to the urban mobility planner, if the planner chose to create an executive summary.",
    "An extensive report describing the consequences of the selected mobility solution has been generated and is available to the urban mobility planner, if the planner chose to create an extensive report.",
    "The generated reports are stored and can be retrieved by the urban mobility planner for later use.",
    "The urban mobility planner has the option to present or distribute the generated reports to recipient stakeholders."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the Urban Mobility Planning Decision Support System already contains all necessary data and analysis results about the consequences of the mobility solution, because the requirement text focuses only on reporting and not on performing the analyses.",
    "It is assumed that a \"solution\" or \"mobility solution\" refers to a previously configured and evaluated set of measures or proposals within the system.",
    "It is assumed that an \"executive summary\" report is a concise, high-level description of the solution consequences aimed at decision makers such as the mayor.",
    "It is assumed that an \"extensive\" report is a more detailed and comprehensive description of the solution consequences aimed at professional audiences such as consultancy companies.",
    "It is assumed that the same underlying solution data can be used to generate both executive summary and extensive reports, differing mainly in level of detail and structure.",
    "It is assumed that recipient stakeholders such as the mayor and consultancy companies do not directly interact with the system, and that only the urban mobility planner interacts with the system to generate and present reports.",
    "It is assumed that the format of the generated reports (for example, document or on-screen view) is supported by the system but is not specified in the requirements and therefore is not constrained by this use case.",
    "It is assumed that the system allows the urban mobility planner to select one existing mobility solution at a time as the subject of a generated report.",
    "It is assumed that report generation is a synchronous interaction from the planner's perspective, meaning the planner waits for the system to create and present the report in the same session.",
    "It is assumed that access control policies for who may later view or export reports are handled by the broader system and are not uniquely defined by this use case."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Urban mobility planner selects the option to generate a solution report → System displays available reporting types and a list of existing mobility solutions that can be reported on.",
    "2. Urban mobility planner selects a specific mobility solution proposal as the subject of the report → System retrieves the stored data and analysis results related to the selected mobility solution proposal.",
    "3. Urban mobility planner chooses to generate an executive summary report, an extensive report, or both for the selected solution → System confirms the selected report types for the chosen solution.",
    "4. Urban mobility planner confirms the report generation request → System composes the content of the executive summary report and, if selected, the extensive report using the stored solution data and analysis results.",
    "5. Urban mobility planner waits while the system processes the request → System generates the requested report documents and stores them in the system as new report artifacts associated with the selected solution.",
    "6. Urban mobility planner views the generated executive summary report and, if applicable, the extensive report on the system interface → System presents the generated report content for review and navigation.",
    "7. Urban mobility planner optionally saves or exports the generated reports using available system options → System confirms that the reports are accessible for future retrieval and potential distribution to recipient stakeholders."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): Urban mobility planner selects only the executive summary report type for the selected solution → System confirms that only an executive summary report will be generated and proceeds directly to Step 4.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 3): Urban mobility planner selects only the extensive report type for the selected solution → System confirms that only an extensive report will be generated and proceeds directly to Step 4.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 6): Urban mobility planner decides to adjust the chosen report types after viewing the generated report → System allows the planner to return to Step 3 for the same selected solution to request an additional or different report type using the existing solution data.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 7): Urban mobility planner chooses to generate another report for a different solution immediately after finishing with the current reports → System returns to Step 1 and displays available reporting options and solutions again."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): The system cannot retrieve the data or analysis results for the selected mobility solution proposal due to missing or corrupted data → System notifies the urban mobility planner that the selected solution cannot be reported on and prompts the planner to select a different solution, then returns to Step 2 with the new selection.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): The system encounters an internal error while composing the report content → System displays an error message indicating that report generation has failed for the selected solution and logs the error; the flow ends without generating a report for that request.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 5): The system runs out of available storage space while attempting to store the generated report artifacts → System informs the urban mobility planner that the report could not be stored and discards the incomplete report; the flow ends and the planner may attempt the process again after storage issues are resolved.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 7): The export or save operation initiated by the urban mobility planner fails (for example, due to file system or network issues) → System notifies the urban mobility planner that the export or save operation failed and leaves the generated report available for retry, then returns to Step 7."

  "information_for_steps": [
