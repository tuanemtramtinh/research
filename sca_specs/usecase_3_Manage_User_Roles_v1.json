    "The authorized actor is successfully authenticated in the IFA Integrated League Management System.",

    "The user accounts to be configured exist in the system.",

    "The term \"IFA\" in the requirements includes one or more authorized IFA representatives who can configure global role and access policies.",
    "The term \"team manager\" refers to an authenticated manager for a specific team with authority to manage roles and privileges for that team’s members only.",

    "The system enforces access restrictions based on configured roles and privileges at login and during feature invocation.",
    "The system maintains an internal user directory in which each user can be uniquely identified and selected for role assignment.",
    "Access restriction to \"only relevant tools\" is implemented purely through configuration of existing tool access, without adding new tools or altering tool behavior."

  "main_flow": [
    "1. team manager or ifa → The actor authenticates to the system and navigates to the user role management area; the system displays the role management interface with available users and existing role configurations according to the actor’s permissions.",
    "2. team manager or ifa → The actor selects a specific user or group of users to manage; the system retrieves and displays current roles and associated privileges for the selected user or users.",
    "3. team manager or ifa → The actor selects one or more existing roles to assign, modify, or remove for the selected user or users; the system highlights the selected roles and shows the associated default privilege set for each selected role.",
    "4. team manager or ifa → The actor reviews and, where permitted, adjusts the detailed privilege options associated with the selected roles (such as enabling or disabling access to specific tools or functions); the system updates the pending configuration to reflect the requested privilege changes without yet committing them.",
    "5. team manager or ifa → The actor confirms and submits the updated role and privilege configuration for the selected user or users; the system validates the configuration against predefined access control rules and organizational constraints.",
    "6. system → Upon successful validation, the system stores the updated roles and privileges for the affected user or users and records an audit entry describing the change.",
    "7. system → The system activates the updated access configuration so that, on subsequent interactions, each affected user can access only the tools and functions associated with their assigned roles and privileges, and the system displays a confirmation of successful update to the actor."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): The actor wants to search or filter users before selection. The actor specifies search or filter criteria such as name, team, or existing role; the system filters and presents the matching subset of users. The actor then selects a user from the filtered list and continues with Step 3.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 3): The actor decides to remove all roles from a user to effectively revoke their access. The actor deselects all roles for the chosen user; the system indicates that the user will have no accessible tools after confirmation. The actor confirms the configuration in Step 5, and the flow continues with Step 6, resulting in a user with no active tool access.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 4): The actor chooses to revert privilege adjustments to role defaults before confirmation. The actor selects an option to reset privileges to the role’s default configuration; the system restores the default privilege set for the selected roles and displays the reset configuration. The flow then continues with Step 5."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): The actor fails authentication or lacks access to the role management area. The system denies access, displays an appropriate error message indicating insufficient permissions or failed login, does not display the role management interface, and the use case terminates without changes.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 5): The submitted configuration violates access control rules or organizational constraints. The system rejects the configuration, displays validation error messages indicating which role or privilege assignments are not allowed, keeps the current stored roles and privileges unchanged, and returns the actor to the configuration view so they can adjust the settings or cancel the operation.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 6): A system error occurs while storing the updated roles and privileges or writing the audit record. The system rolls back the attempted changes, preserves the previous role and privilege configuration, logs the error for technical review, informs the actor that the update could not be completed due to a system problem, and the use case ends without applying any changes."
