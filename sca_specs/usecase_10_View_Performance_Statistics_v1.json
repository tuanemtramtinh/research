  "description": "This use case describes how a team staff member accesses and views match and player performance statistics that have been generated by the system from reported match events, to support analysis and strategic planning.",

  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA Integrated League Management System is operational and reachable by the team staff member.",
    "The team staff member has valid credentials and an active user account with permission to view statistics.",
    "Relevant matches and players have been created and maintained within the system.",

    "The system has presented the requested match and/or player statistics to the team staff member.",
    "Any filtering, sorting, or selection criteria applied by the team staff member have been reflected in the displayed statistics.",
    "No changes have been made to the underlying match, player, or event data as a result of viewing statistics."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "The IFA Integrated League Management System already includes functionality to generate statistics directly from reported match events as referenced in the requirement \"As the IFA, I want to derive player and match statistics directly from reported match events, so that no extra work needs to be done.\" and the included use case \"generate statistics\".",
    "Statistics are generated and updated by the system independently of this use case, so the act of viewing statistics does not initiate new computation beyond retrieval and formatting.",
    "The team staff member accesses the system through an existing supported interface (such as desktop or mobile) that is already covered by other requirements and does not need to be specified further in this use case.",
    "Access control rules that restrict user access to only relevant tools, as described by the IFA, are already implemented so that the team staff member can only view statistics they are permitted to see.",
    "The included use case \"view match statistics\" represents a focused interaction on match-specific statistics that is executed as part of this broader performance statistics viewing flow."

  "requirements_met": [

    "The system shall present player statistics to the team staff member based on the players selected by the team staff member.",
    "The system shall retrieve and display statistics that are derived directly from reported match events.",
    "The system shall restrict access to statistics according to the team staff member’s assigned roles and system privileges.",

    "The specific set of match statistics (e.g., goals, shots, possession, cards) to be displayed to team staff members has not been fully defined.",
    "The specific set of player statistics (e.g., minutes played, goals, assists, cards) to be displayed to team staff members has not been fully defined.",
    "The degree of historical depth for statistics (e.g., last match, season-to-date, multi-season) available to team staff members remains to be specified.",
    "The exact filtering and sorting capabilities for statistics (e.g., by competition, by date range, by home/away) require clarification.",
    "Presentation format requirements for statistics (e.g., tables only, charts, export functionality) have not been documented in this requirement set."
  ],
  "main_flow": [
    "1. Team staff member initiates the statistics view feature from within the system → System displays a statistics overview interface indicating available statistics categories such as match statistics and player statistics.",
    "2. Team staff member selects the option to view performance statistics → System invokes the included \"generate statistics\" functionality to ensure the latest derived statistics from reported match events are available for retrieval.",
    "3. Team staff member specifies the desired statistics scope (for example by selecting competition, season, team, date range, or similar criteria) → System records the selection criteria and confirms the chosen scope.",
    "4. Team staff member confirms the request to view match statistics within the specified scope → System performs the included \"view match statistics\" behavior by retrieving the corresponding match-level performance statistics based on the selection criteria.",
    "5. Team staff member optionally chooses to view player statistics related to the selected matches or team → System retrieves and prepares player-level performance statistics associated with the specified scope.",
    "6. Team staff member reviews the displayed match and player performance statistics on screen → System presents the statistics in a structured format that reflects any applied scope or selections.",
    "7. Team staff member optionally adjusts selection criteria to refine the statistics being viewed → System updates the retrieved match and player statistics and refreshes the displayed results according to the revised criteria.",
    "8. Team staff member finishes the analysis session and exits the statistics view interface → System terminates the statistics viewing session and returns the team staff member to the previous system context without altering underlying data."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 5): Team staff member focuses only on match statistics. Condition: The team staff member decides not to view player statistics. Flow: At Step 5, the team staff member does not select any player-related option → System skips retrieval of player-level statistics and maintains only match statistics on the screen → Use case resumes at Step 6 with the team staff member reviewing only match statistics.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 7): Team staff member saves a preferred statistics scope for quick reuse. Condition: The system supports saving user-specific view preferences as part of configuration already available. Flow: At Step 7, after adjusting selection criteria, the team staff member invokes an existing save-preferences function → System stores the current selection criteria as the team staff member’s preferred statistics scope for future sessions → Use case resumes at Step 7 with the system refreshing statistics, now also indicating that the current scope has been saved."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): Authentication or authorization failure. Condition: The team staff member is not logged in or lacks permission to view performance statistics. Flow: At Step 1, when the team staff member attempts to initiate the statistics view feature, the system detects that authentication has failed or that the user role does not have the required privilege → System denies access to the statistics view, displays an error message indicating insufficient permissions or the need to log in, and does not proceed with the use case → Use case terminates without displaying statistics.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 2): Statistics generation unavailable. Condition: The included \"generate statistics\" functionality is temporarily unavailable or fails. Flow: At Step 2, when the system invokes the \"generate statistics\" behavior, the system encounters an error or cannot complete the generation process → System logs the failure, informs the team staff member that up-to-date statistics are temporarily unavailable, and may offer to display only previously stored statistics if they exist → If no statistics can be retrieved, the use case terminates without completing the remaining steps.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): No statistics match the specified scope. Condition: The selection criteria specified by the team staff member do not correspond to any available match statistics. Flow: At Step 4, when the system attempts to retrieve match statistics based on the specified scope, the query returns no data → System displays a clear message indicating that no statistics are available for the chosen criteria and prompts the team staff member to modify the scope → Use case can continue with Step 7 if the team staff member decides to adjust the selection criteria; otherwise, the use case terminates without displaying statistics.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 6): System performance or timeout issue while displaying statistics. Condition: Retrieval or rendering of statistics exceeds an acceptable time threshold. Flow: At Step 6, during display of match and player statistics, the operation times out or fails due to performance constraints → System displays an error notification indicating that the statistics could not be fully loaded and suggests the team staff member try again later or narrow the selection scope → Use case terminates after notification if the statistics cannot be successfully displayed."
