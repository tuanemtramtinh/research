  "description": "This use case describes how a fan or match official configures notification preferences for game events and receives system-generated notifications about important schedule changes and game events in a timely and consistent manner.",
  "triggering_event": "A fan or match official initiates management of notifications or a schedule change or game event occurs that requires notification delivery according to existing preferences.",
  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The IFA Integrated League Management System is operational and available to users.",
    "The fan or match official has an active user account within the system.",
    "The fan or match official is authenticated in the system when changing notification preferences.",
    "The system has access to current game schedules and game event data.",
    "The system has stored at least a default notification configuration for each registered user."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "The system has stored the latest notification preferences for the fan or match official.",
    "For any schedule change or relevant game event that occurs after preference configuration, notifications have been generated in accordance with the stored preferences.",
    "All stakeholders identified by the IFA as requiring notification for a schedule change or game event have been notified simultaneously and in a consistent manner, subject to their preferences.",
    "Notification delivery attempts and outcomes for the fan and match official have been recorded in the system."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that device-specific delivery mechanisms (such as mobile push or desktop browser notifications) are handled within the IFA Integrated League Management System and do not require separate actors.",
    "It is assumed that fans can configure which types of game events they will be notified about, but match officials receive all schedule change notifications relevant to their assigned games without filtering by event type.",
    "It is assumed that the system applies IFA policies for which schedule changes and game events are deemed important enough to trigger notifications.",
    "It is assumed that when the IFA requires simultaneous notifications, the system sends notifications to all targeted users within a practically negligible time difference and using the same notification channel type per policy.",
    "It is assumed that users can access the system via both mobile devices and desktop environments as supported by the overarching platform requirements.",
    "It is assumed that the system time and schedule information are accurate and synchronized such that notifications about schedule changes and game events can be evaluated as timely.",
    "It is assumed that network connectivity and end-user device availability are outside the control of the system; the system is responsible only for initiating notifications.",
    "It is assumed that the system maintains user identity and role information (fan or match official) to determine applicable notifications and configuration options."

    "The system shall allow fans to configure which game event types they wish to be notified about so that they can limit the volume of notifications they receive.",
    "The system shall notify all relevant stakeholders of a game event simultaneously and using a consistent notification method as defined by IFA policy.",
    "The system shall store and apply user-specific notification preferences when determining whether to send notifications for schedule changes and game events.",

    "The specific definition of 'as soon as possible' for notification timeliness (e.g., maximum acceptable delay in seconds or minutes) has not been specified.",
    "The policy for which schedule changes and game events are considered 'important' and must always trigger notifications has not been fully detailed.",
    "The exact notification channels (such as in-app notification, email, SMS, or push notifications) have not been formally specified.",
    "The rules for how notification preferences interact with the IFA requirement to notify all stakeholders simultaneously have not been clarified.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. fan or match official initiates notification settings from their client device → System displays the current notification configuration options applicable to the user role.",
    "2. fan or match official reviews existing notification preferences → System retrieves and presents stored notification preferences for schedule changes and game events.",
    "3. fan adjusts selected game event types and, if available, schedule change notification options → System validates the updated preferences and prepares them for storage.",
    "4. match official, when allowed, reviews schedule change notification settings for assigned games → System ensures that mandatory schedule change notifications remain enabled according to IFA policy.",
    "5. fan or match official confirms and saves the notification configuration → System stores the updated notification preferences linked to the user account.",
    "6. An important schedule change or relevant game event is recorded in the system for one or more games → System evaluates which fans and match officials are affected based on their role, association with the game, and stored notification preferences.",
    "7. System prepares notification messages for all affected stakeholders in a consistent format → System schedules notification delivery such that all targeted stakeholders are notified simultaneously according to IFA policy.",
    "8. System delivers notifications to the fan and match official via the configured delivery mechanism → System records the notification delivery attempt and marks the notifications as sent for the corresponding users.",
    "9. fan or match official accesses the system and views the received notification details → System presents the relevant schedule change or game event information associated with the notification."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): fan chooses to disable notifications for certain non-critical game event types while retaining notifications for schedule changes. Condition: The system allows de-selection of optional event types according to IFA policy. System response: System updates the preference set to exclude the chosen event types and returns to Step 5 for confirmation and storage.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): A game event occurs that is not covered by any user-specific event preference but is flagged by the IFA as mandatory for all stakeholders. Condition: IFA policy designates the event type as always-notify. System response: System includes all relevant stakeholders in the notification target set regardless of their individual preferences and proceeds with Steps 7 to 9.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): User is temporarily offline when the system delivers notifications. Condition: The delivery mechanism supports deferred presentation. System response: System records that the notification is pending user retrieval and presents the notification to the fan or match official during their next successful interaction with the system, then continues with Step 9."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 1): The fan or match official is not authenticated when attempting to access notification settings. Condition: The user session has expired or is invalid. System response: System denies access to notification configuration, prompts the user to authenticate, and terminates the current instance of the use case.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 5): The system fails to store updated notification preferences due to an internal error. Condition: Data persistence error occurs. System response: System does not overwrite existing preferences, logs the error, informs the user that the update could not be saved, and ends the use case with existing preferences remaining in effect.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 8): Notification delivery to the fan or match official cannot be completed. Condition: Delivery to the configured channel fails irrecoverably. System response: System logs the failed delivery attempt, may attempt a limited number of retries as configured, and, after retries are exhausted, marks the notification as failed without further delivery attempts and ends the notification instance."
