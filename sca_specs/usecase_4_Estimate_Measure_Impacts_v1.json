  "main_flow": [
    "1. Urban mobility planner selects the option to estimate measure impacts → System displays an input interface for defining or selecting a traffic-related measure or event for impact estimation.",
    "2. Urban mobility planner specifies or selects the measure or event context, including relevant parameters such as location, time frame, and type of measure → System records the selected context and parameters for the estimation session.",
    "3. Urban mobility planner initiates review of sensor data as part of the estimation process → System invokes the included \"review sensor data\" functionality and displays relevant traffic and pollution sensor data associated with the selected context.",
    "4. Urban mobility planner examines the displayed sensor data and confirms the selection of sensor data sets to be used for impact estimation → System stores the reference to the confirmed sensor data sets for subsequent calculations.",
    "5. Urban mobility planner requests estimation of the cost impact for the selected measure or event → System applies the configured cost estimation model using the selected context and sensor data and calculates the estimated cost impact.",
    "6. Urban mobility planner requests estimation of the emission impact for the selected measure or event → System applies the configured emission estimation model using the selected context and sensor data and calculates the estimated emission impact.",
    "7. Urban mobility planner requests estimation of the noise impact for the selected measure or event → System applies the configured noise estimation model using the selected context and sensor data and calculates the estimated noise impact.",

    "AF-1 (from Step 5): Urban mobility planner decides to skip explicit cost estimation. Condition: The planner is only interested in environmental impacts for the current session. The planner does not perform Step 5 and proceeds directly to Step 6. The use case then continues with environmental impact estimations and still completes successfully.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 6): Urban mobility planner decides to skip explicit emission estimation. Condition: The planner is only interested in cost and noise impacts for the current session. The planner does not perform Step 6 and proceeds directly to Step 7. The use case then continues and still completes successfully.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): Urban mobility planner decides to skip explicit noise estimation. Condition: The planner is only interested in cost and emission impacts for the current session. The planner does not perform Step 7 and proceeds directly to Step 8. The use case then continues and still completes successfully.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 3): Urban mobility planner narrows the review of sensor data. Condition: The planner chooses to filter sensor data by additional criteria such as specific sensors or dates. The planner applies filters and confirms the filtered sensor data in Step 4. The use case then continues with Step 5.",
    "AF-5 (from Step 8): Urban mobility planner requests separate detailed views.

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): Missing or invalid measure context. If the urban mobility planner provides incomplete or invalid measure or event parameters, the system detects the issue, displays an error message indicating the missing or invalid information, and prompts the planner to correct the input. The use case resumes at Step 2 after correction; if the planner cancels, the use case terminates without producing impact estimations.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): Sensor data unavailable. If relevant sensor data for the selected context cannot be retrieved from the Traffic and Environmental Sensor Data Repository, the system notifies the planner that no suitable sensor data are available and logs the incident. The planner may choose to modify the context (returning to Step 2) or cancel the operation, in which case the use case ends without estimations.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 5): Cost estimation calculation failure. If the cost estimation model cannot be executed due to internal calculation errors or missing configuration, the system displays a message indicating that cost estimation is currently unavailable, records the error, and allows the planner to proceed with Steps 6 and 7 for environmental estimations. The use case then continues with the available results and completes at Step 9, with cost values marked as unavailable.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 6): Emission estimation calculation failure. If the emission estimation model cannot be executed due to internal calculation errors or missing configuration, the system displays a message indicating that emission estimation is currently unavailable, records the error, and allows the planner to proceed with Step 7 and subsequent steps. The use case completes at Step 9 with emission values marked as unavailable.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 7): Noise estimation calculation failure. If the noise estimation model cannot be executed due to internal calculation errors or missing configuration, the system displays a message indicating that noise estimation is currently unavailable, records the error, and allows the planner to proceed with Step 8 and Step 9. The use case completes with noise values marked as unavailable.",
    "EF-6 (from Step 1): Loss of system availability. If the system becomes unavailable after the planner has initiated the use case, the system stops processing, any unsaved session data may be lost, and the planner is informed upon reconnection that the estimation session did not complete. The use case terminates without valid estimation results."
