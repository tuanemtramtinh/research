    "Billing department employee: Needs complete and accurate appointment dates, start times, end times, and doctor-entered appointment information to verify that the patient bill is correct.",

  "trigger_type": "External",
  "preconditions": [
    "The billing department employee has an active user account with permission to access appointment information for billing purposes.",
    "The billing department employee is successfully authenticated in the Hospital Management System.",
    "The appointment to be verified has been created in the system.",
    "The doctor has recorded the appointment information in the system prior to the billing verification.",

    "The billing department employee has viewed the appointment date associated with the appointment being verified.",
    "The billing department employee has viewed the appointment start time and end time associated with the appointment being verified.",

  "assumptions": [
    "It is assumed that the hospital management system provides a means for the billing department employee to locate an appointment using available identifiers (such as patient identity or appointment reference), even though this search capability is not explicitly described in the requirement text.",
    "It is assumed that the appointment start time, end time, date, and doctor-entered appointment information are already stored and available in the system at the time the billing department employee performs this use case.",
    "It is assumed that access control is configured so that the billing department employee can only view appointment details required for billing verification and that this access is compliant with applicable regulations such as GDPR, although the detailed access rules are not specified in the requirement text.",
    "It is assumed that the display of appointment details to the billing department employee is strictly read-only for this use case and does not allow modification of appointment data, even though the requirement text does not explicitly state the read-only constraint.",
    "It is assumed that the system maintains a log of user access to appointment information for audit purposes, as this is consistent with typical requirements for a hospital management system that must comply with regulations."

  "outstanding_issues": [
    "The precise search criteria and filters that the billing department employee may use to locate the appointment (for example, by patient, doctor, or date range) are not defined and require clarification.",
    "The maximum historical period for which appointment details remain accessible to billing department employees is not specified and requires a retention policy decision.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Billing department employee selects the option to view appointment details in the Hospital Management System → System displays an interface for locating and selecting an appointment for billing verification.",
    "2. Billing department employee identifies the target appointment to verify (for example, by providing patient or appointment reference information) → System searches the stored appointments and presents a list or single match corresponding to the provided identification data.",
    "3. Billing department employee selects the relevant appointment from the presented result set → System retrieves the stored date, start time, end time, and doctor-entered appointment information for the selected appointment.",
    "4. Billing department employee confirms the request to view details for the selected appointment → System displays the appointment date associated with the appointment being verified.",
    "5. Billing department employee reviews the appointment date → System displays the appointment start time and end time associated with the appointment being verified.",
    "6. Billing department employee reviews the appointment start time and end time → System displays the appointment information that the doctor entered into the system for the selected appointment.",
    "7. Billing department employee reviews the doctor-entered appointment information → System completes the presentation of all appointment details required for billing verification and maintains the session for further review or closure by the billing department employee."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): If the billing department employee’s identification data matches multiple appointments, the system presents all matching appointments ordered by date and time; the billing department employee selects the correct appointment from the list, after which the use case continues at Step 3.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 2): If the billing department employee’s identification data uniquely identifies a single appointment, the system bypasses an explicit result list and directly proceeds to retrieve appointment details as described in Step 3, after which the use case continues at Step 4.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 7): If the billing department employee needs to review additional appointments for the same patient during the same session, the billing department employee initiates a new appointment selection using the same interface; the system returns to Step 2 for the newly selected appointment."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): If no appointment matches the identification data provided by the billing department employee, the system informs the billing department employee that no matching appointment could be found and prompts for different identification data; the use case returns to Step 2 and does not progress until a matching appointment is identified.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): If the system fails to retrieve the appointment details due to a data access error, the system logs the error, informs the billing department employee that the appointment details are temporarily unavailable, and terminates the current execution of the use case without displaying incomplete data.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 4): If the billing department employee’s session has expired before appointment details are displayed, the system requires the billing department employee to authenticate again; after successful authentication, the billing department employee must reinitiate the use case from Step 1.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 1): If the billing department employee does not have sufficient access rights to view appointment details, the system denies access, informs the billing department employee that permission is insufficient, and terminates the use case without revealing any appointment information."
