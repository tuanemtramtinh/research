The librarians manage the digital catalog by adding new book records and updating existing entries. When a student searches for a book, the system displays the availability status in real-time. If the student decides to borrow a book, the automated kiosk scans their ID card and records the transaction in the database. After the loan period expires, the management system sends email notifications to the borrowers. Meanwhile, administrators generate monthly reports to monitor library usage and track late returns.
