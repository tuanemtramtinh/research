A user first visits the online store to browse products. The customer adds a desired item to the shopping cart. Once the shopper is ready, they proceed to the checkout page. The buyer then provides shipping information and chooses a payment method. The system sends the transaction details to the Payment Gateway. It validates the credit card information and sends a confirmation back. Finally, the Store Manager receives a notification about the order, and he prepares the package for shipping.
