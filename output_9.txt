    "AF-1 (from Step 2): Depositor or research facility manager chooses to update an existing dataset instead of creating a new dataset record. Condition: The actor intends to modify an existing dataset rather than deposit a completely new one. Flow: At the dataset management home screen, the actor searches for or selects an existing dataset. The system retrieves and displays the selected dataset record with its details and version history. The flow then continues from Step 8 where the actor creates a new version for the existing dataset.",

Condition: The actor is a research facility manager depositing facility-generated data that belongs to one or more researchers. Flow: The research facility manager selects one or more researchers on whose behalf the facility data is being deposited when selecting the dataset files or live data sources. The system associates the dataset and its content with the identified researchers for subsequent access. The flow then continues from Step 5 where the facility data is deposited as part of the dataset.",

Flow: The system identifies invalid or missing fields and displays error messages indicating what must be corrected. The actor reviews and corrects the dataset information and resubmits it. If corrections are successfully made, the flow returns to Step 3 validation; if the actor cancels, the use case terminates without creating or updating a dataset.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): File upload or live data registration fails. Condition: One or more selected files or live data sources cannot be uploaded or registered due to technical issues such as connectivity problems, storage limitations, or incompatible input. Flow: The system reports which files or live data sources failed to be accepted and provides the reason where available. The actor may retry the selection or remove problematic items and proceed with the remaining content. If the actor proceeds with corrected selections, the flow resumes at Step 4; if the actor cancels, the use case terminates without depositing or updating the dataset.",

Condition: After confirmation, the system cannot complete the creation of the dataset record and its initial version, for example due to a system error or storage failure. Flow: The system displays an error message indicating that the dataset could not be created and rolls back any partial changes so that no inconsistent dataset record remains. The actor may choose to attempt the deposit process again later, in which case a new instance of the use case is started, or may exit, in which case this instance of the use case ends without success.",

  "main_flow": [
    "1. Depositor selects an existing dataset or live research data collection in the system to be shared → System displays the current details of the selected dataset or live research data, including existing access settings.",
    "2. Depositor initiates the access management function for the selected dataset by choosing to manage access and delegation settings → System invokes the included \"manage dataset access policies\" functionality and presents available access policy options for the selected dataset.",
    "3. Depositor specifies collaborators and collaborators' roles for privileged access by selecting one or more collaborators (including any external collaborators or external coordinators) and indicating that they should have privileged access to the selected dataset or live research data → System records the specified collaborators and proposed privileged access configuration in a pending access policy for the dataset.",
    "4. Depositor defines the scope of privileged access for the selected collaborators, such as which parts of the dataset or live research data they may access and under what general conditions, using the access policy interface → System updates the pending access policy for the dataset with the defined scope of privileged access for each specified collaborator.",
    "5. Depositor specifies any users who are allowed to deposit datasets on their behalf, including optionally designating a research facility manager or other trusted party as a delegated depositor for the dataset or associated project → System records the designated delegated depositors and associates their delegation with the depositor and the relevant dataset or project context in the pending access policy.",
    "6. Depositor reviews the combined privileged access and delegation configuration for the dataset or live research data, including listed collaborators and delegated depositors, using the access management interface → System displays a summary of the pending access policy changes and indicates how each collaborator and delegated depositor will be able to interact with the dataset.",
    "7. Depositor confirms and saves the configured access and delegation settings for the selected dataset or live research data → System validates the configuration, applies the access policy to the dataset or live research data, activates the specified privileged access for collaborators, enables delegated deposit for designated users, and records the change in an access control audit log.",
    "8. Research facility manager, acting as a delegated depositor, submits a new dataset or updates an existing dataset on behalf of an associated researcher or depositor via the archive interface → System verifies the research facility manager's delegated deposit rights from the applied access policies, accepts the deposit or update on behalf of the associated researcher or depositor, and associates the resulting dataset with the correct owner and project context.",
    "9. External collaborator accesses the archive through the web interface and navigates to the shared dataset or live research data for a project in which they are involved → System authenticates the external collaborator and grants privileged access to the dataset or live research data in accordance with the applied access policy, allowing interaction consistent with the configured permissions.",
    "10. External coordinator accesses the archive from an off-campus location to view project data shared with them by Bath collaborators → System authenticates the external coordinator, applies the same access policies regardless of location, and grants privileged access to the project datasets that have been shared with them.",
    "11. System maintains and enforces the configured access policies for all subsequent interactions with the shared dataset or live research data, ensuring that collaborators retain the granted privileged access and delegated depositors can continue to deposit on behalf of the depositor or associated researchers."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 3): Depositor omits external collaborators and grants privileged access only to internal collaborators for the selected dataset. Condition: The depositor decides that only internal colleagues should have privileged access. Flow: Depositor selects only internal collaborators as privileged users in Step 3, proceeds with defining access scope in Step 4 and delegation in Step 5 as usual, and then continues with Steps 6 and 7 to save the configuration. Outcome: Only internal collaborators receive privileged access according to the applied access policy.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 5): Depositor chooses not to enable delegated deposit for any users. Condition: The depositor wants to retain sole responsibility for depositing datasets. Flow: In Step 5, the depositor skips adding any delegated depositors and leaves delegation options unselected while still proceeding to review in Step 6 and confirm in Step 7. Outcome: No delegated deposit is enabled, but privileged access for collaborators configured in earlier steps remains active.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 8): Research facility manager deposits facility-generated data as a new dataset for multiple researchers. Condition: The facility data pertains to more than one researcher within a project. Flow: In Step 8, the research facility manager selects a project context and associates multiple researchers with the new dataset while depositing on their behalf. The system verifies delegated rights for each associated researcher and, upon successful verification, creates a dataset linked to all specified researchers, then the flow continues to policy enforcement as implied in Step 11. Outcome: The dataset is deposited once but associated with multiple researchers while still recognising the depositor as the research facility manager acting under delegated rights.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 9): External collaborator first logs in and then navigates via a project view. Condition: The external collaborator does not have a direct dataset link but has project-level access. Flow: Before Step 9, the external collaborator logs in to the web interface and selects the relevant project from a list of accessible projects; then Step 9 occurs with navigation to the shared dataset through the project view. The system continues as described in Step 9 and then Step 11. Outcome: Project-based navigation still results in privileged access to the same dataset under the configured policies."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 3): Collaborator identity not found. Condition: The depositor attempts to grant privileged access to a collaborator whose account is not recognised by the system. Flow: When the depositor enters the collaborator's identifier in Step 3, the system is unable to match it to an existing user account and displays an error indicating that the collaborator cannot be added until they have a recognised account. The system prompts the depositor to correct the identifier or remove the collaborator from the access list. The depositor may retry Step 3 with corrected information or cancel the access change process, in which case no access policy changes are saved.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 5): Invalid or unauthorised delegated depositor. Condition: The depositor designates a user as a delegated depositor who is not eligible according to system or institutional rules. Flow: In Step 5, when the depositor attempts to add the delegated depositor, the system checks eligibility and determines that delegation is not allowed for that user. The system rejects the delegation entry, informs the depositor that the selected user cannot be granted deposit-on-behalf rights, and returns to Step 5 for the depositor to select a different user or proceed without delegation.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 7): Access policy validation failure. Condition: The configured access and delegation settings conflict with mandatory institutional rules (for example, attempting to grant privileged access where the dataset must remain restricted). Flow: During Step 7, the system validates the configuration and detects a conflict, preventing application of the new policy. The system displays validation messages describing the conflict and keeps the previous access policy in effect. The depositor may adjust the settings by returning to the relevant configuration steps (Steps 3 to 5) and then repeat Step 7, or cancel the changes entirely.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 8): Delegated depositor attempts deposit without valid delegation. Condition: A research facility manager or other user attempts to deposit data on behalf of a researcher without an active delegation assignment. Flow: In Step 8, the system checks delegation and determines that no valid delegation exists for the asserted relationship. The system rejects the deposit-on-behalf action, informs the user that they are not currently authorised to deposit on behalf of that researcher, and does not create or modify any dataset. The user may either submit the dataset under their own account if allowed or request that the depositor configure appropriate delegation.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 9): External collaborator lacks privileged access. Condition: An external collaborator attempts to access a dataset that has not been shared with them. Flow: In Step 9, when the external collaborator navigates to the dataset, the system evaluates the access policy and determines that the user does not have the required privileged access. The system denies access to restricted content, displays an appropriate access denied message, and does not reveal non-public data. The collaborator may contact the depositor outside the system to request access.",
    "EF-6 (from Step 10): Off-campus access blocked by security policy. Condition: An external coordinator attempts to access shared data from off campus but institutional security settings temporarily prevent access. Flow: In Step 10, the system detects that the access attempt from the off-campus location does not meet current security requirements (for example, missing required secure connection). The system refuses to display protected dataset content and informs the user that additional security steps are required. The flow terminates without data access until the coordinator satisfies the security requirements and retries."

Depositor confirms and saves the configured access and delegation settings for the selected dataset or live research data → System validates the configuration, applies the access policy to the dataset or live research data, activates the specified privileged access for collaborators, enables delegated deposit for designated users, and records the change in an access control audit log.",
      "8. Research facility manager, acting as a delegated depositor, submits a new dataset or updates an existing dataset on behalf of an associated researcher or depositor via the archive interface → System verifies the research facility manager's delegated deposit rights from the applied access policies, accepts the deposit or update on behalf of the associated researcher or depositor, and associates the resulting dataset with the correct owner and project context.",

External collaborator accesses the archive through the web interface and navigates to the shared dataset or live research data for a project in which they are involved → System authenticates the external collaborator and grants privileged access to the dataset or live research data in accordance with the applied access policy, allowing interaction consistent with the configured permissions.",

    "alternative_flows": [
      "AF-1 (from Step 3): Depositor omits external collaborators and grants privileged access only to internal collaborators for the selected dataset. Condition: The depositor decides that only internal colleagues should have privileged access. Flow: Depositor selects only internal collaborators as privileged users in Step 3, proceeds with defining access scope in Step 4 and delegation in Step 5 as usual, and then continues with Steps 6 and 7 to save the configuration. Outcome: Only internal collaborators receive privileged access according to the applied access policy.",
      "AF-2 (from Step 5): Depositor chooses not to enable delegated deposit for any users. Condition: The depositor wants to retain sole responsibility for depositing datasets. Flow: In Step 5, the depositor skips adding any delegated depositors and leaves delegation options unselected while still proceeding to review in Step 6 and confirm in Step 7. Outcome: No delegated deposit is enabled, but privileged access for collaborators configured in earlier steps remains active.",
      "AF-3 (from Step 8): Research facility manager deposits facility-generated data as a new dataset for multiple researchers. Condition: The facility data pertains to more than one researcher within a project. Flow: In Step 8, the research facility manager selects a project context and associates multiple researchers with the new dataset while depositing on their behalf. The system verifies delegated rights for each associated researcher and, upon successful verification, creates a dataset linked to all specified researchers, then the flow continues to policy enforcement as implied in Step 11. Outcome: The dataset is deposited once but associated with multiple researchers while still recognising the depositor as the research facility manager acting under delegated rights.",
      "AF-4 (from Step 9): External collaborator first logs in and then navigates via a project view. Condition: The external collaborator does not have a direct dataset link but has project-level access. Flow: Before Step 9, the external collaborator logs in to the web interface and selects the relevant project from a list of accessible projects; then Step 9 occurs with navigation to the shared dataset through the project view. The system continues as described in Step 9 and then Step 11. Outcome: Project-based navigation still results in privileged access to the same dataset under the configured policies."
    ],
    "exception_flows": [
      "EF-1 (from Step 3): Collaborator identity not found. Condition: The depositor attempts to grant privileged access to a collaborator whose account is not recognised by the system. Flow: When the depositor enters the collaborator's identifier in Step 3, the system is unable to match it to an existing user account and displays an error indicating that the collaborator cannot be added until they have a recognised account. The system prompts the depositor to correct the identifier or remove the collaborator from the access list. The depositor may retry Step 3 with corrected information or cancel the access change process, in which case no access policy changes are saved.",
      "EF-2 (from Step 5): Invalid or unauthorised delegated depositor. Condition: The depositor designates a user as a delegated depositor who is not eligible according to system or institutional rules. Flow: In Step 5, when the depositor attempts to add the delegated depositor, the system checks eligibility and determines that delegation is not allowed for that user. The system rejects the delegation entry, informs the depositor that the selected user cannot be granted deposit-on-behalf rights, and returns to Step 5 for the depositor to select a different user or proceed without delegation.",
      "EF-3 (from Step 7): Access policy validation failure. Condition: The configured access and delegation settings conflict with mandatory institutional rules (for example, attempting to grant privileged access where the dataset must remain restricted). Flow: During Step 7, the system validates the configuration and detects a conflict, preventing application of the new policy. The system displays validation messages describing the conflict and keeps the previous access policy in effect. The depositor may adjust the settings by returning to the relevant configuration steps (Steps 3 to 5) and then repeat Step 7, or cancel the changes entirely.",
      "EF-4 (from Step 8): Delegated depositor attempts deposit without valid delegation. Condition: A research facility manager or other user attempts to deposit data on behalf of a researcher without an active delegation assignment. Flow: In Step 8, the system checks delegation and determines that no valid delegation exists for the asserted relationship. The system rejects the deposit-on-behalf action, informs the user that they are not currently authorised to deposit on behalf of that researcher, and does not create or modify any dataset. The user may either submit the dataset under their own account if allowed or request that the depositor configure appropriate delegation.",
      "EF-5 (from Step 9): External collaborator lacks privileged access. Condition: An external collaborator attempts to access a dataset that has not been shared with them. Flow: In Step 9, when the external collaborator navigates to the dataset, the system evaluates the access policy and determines that the user does not have the required privileged access. The system denies access to restricted content, displays an appropriate access denied message, and does not reveal non-public data. The collaborator may contact the depositor outside the system to request access.",
      "EF-6 (from Step 10): Off-campus access blocked by security policy. Condition: An external coordinator attempts to access shared data from off campus but institutional security settings temporarily prevent access. Flow: In Step 10, the system detects that the access attempt from the off-campus location does not meet current security requirements (for example, missing required secure connection). The system refuses to display protected dataset content and informs the user that additional security steps are required. The flow terminates without data access until the coordinator satisfies the security requirements and retries."

If no valid responses remain, the system informs the actor that the operation could not be completed and the use case ends without changes to archive holdings.",

      "3. Developer submits dataset metadata and file payloads in the API request → System parses the submitted metadata and files and prepares them for processing.",
      "4. Developer indicates through the API whether the operation is a new dataset deposit or an update to an existing dataset → System determines whether to create a new dataset record or modify an existing one based on the request parameters.",
      "5. Developer confirms the dataset content and associated request parameters in the API call → System stores the dataset files and metadata in the Bath Data Archive in accordance with the requested operation.",

      "AF-2 (from Step 7): If the developer does not require ongoing maintenance of the dataset via the API after the initial deposit, the external service may simply store the returned identifier for reference, and the use case ends after Step 6 with the dataset remaining available in the archive without further API interactions."

      "EF-2 (from Step 3): If the submitted metadata or file payloads are incomplete, malformed, or violate defined validation rules, the system rejects the request, returns an error response indicating the validation issues, and leaves existing dataset records unchanged; the developer may correct the request and re-initiate the use case.",
      "EF-3 (from Step 5): If the system encounters a storage or internal processing error while attempting to store dataset files or metadata, the system aborts the operation, rolls back any partial changes where feasible, and returns an error response to the external service; the use case ends without a new or updated dataset being available."
