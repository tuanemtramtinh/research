As a UMD employee, I want to see a real-time simulation of the current traffic situation of Wonderland, so that I can take more informed decisions
As a UMD employee, I want to have an up-to-date map of the streets of Wonderland (including different road types and obstacles), so that I have an accurate background for the traffic simulator.
As a UMD employee, I want to see the current traffic on the map (gathered from the sensors in Wonderland), so that I can monitor the current situation including busy areas and congestions
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to see a heat map of the traffic, so that I can quickly see how the crowdedness is spread in Wonderland at the moment
As a UMD employee, I want to see environmental measures (taken at points in the city), real-time on the map, so that I know how the current traffic situation is affecting the environment
As a UMD employee, I want to see the overall real-time co2 emissions, so that I know how harmful the traffic situation is to the environment
As a UMD employee, I want to see the real-time level of noise per measure point in the map, so that I can see if the noise levels do not exceed the legal limits
As a UMD employee, I want to see the real-time overall level of air pollution, so that I know how harmful the traffic situation is to the environment
As a UMD employee, I want to see the real-time levels of air pollution per measure point in the map, so that I can see it when a certain area is getting too polluted
As a UMD employee, I want to save all historical data, so that I am able to create meaningful insights about this data at a later moment.
As a UMD employee, I want to save the simulator data (map, traffic and heatmap) of every moment coupled to that specific time, so that I can look into them at a later moment
As a UMD employee, I want to save the environmental measures of every moment coupled to that specific time, so that I can look into them at a later moment
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to compare historical traffic data, so that I can use the data to create meaningful analyses
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to select a specific period of time to see the “data” from
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to see compare the data from 2 different times next to each other, so that I can compare the 2 situations with each other
As a UMD employee, I want to use historic data to compare multiple situations to compare the results of 2 different solutions that we have built
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to perform repeatable analysis for situations that are similar, so that the workflow is accelerated
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to make predictions about future traffic situations based on similar situations in the past, so that I can take more informed decisions
As a UMD employee, I want to know when an area is expected to be too crowded, so that i can work on a solution to avoid the problem
As a UMD employee, I want to make predictions about the consequences of changing the urban planning of Wonderland, so that I can rely on data when making a decision
As a UMD employee, I want to see the credibility of the prediction simulator, so that I know how much I can rely on the data of the system
As a UMD employee, I want to compare the predicted environmental levels of the simulator to the actual levels measured by the sensors
As a UMD employee, I want to use an intuitive system, so that I can quickly understand all the functions in the system.
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to independently add more data sources later, so that I can keep up to date with the most complete data
As a UMD employee, I want to add new sensor measurements to the map when they become available, so that my simulator is as accurate as possible
As a UMD employee, I want to use new data sources as they become available, so that my simulator is as accurate as possible.As a UMD employee, I want the system to always be available, so that I can access it whenever I need
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to access the system 24/7, so that I can work flexible shifts
As a UMD employee, I want to start up the system within 2 minutes, so that I can go to action fast when it is required.
As a UMD employee, I want to operate the platform independently without needing an expert, so that I don’t have to ask for assistance.
As a UMD employee, I want to use the system remotely, so that my employees can work from home.
As a UMD employee, I want to be able to take snapshots of specific days, or parts of the day, so that I can execute simulations against those scenarios.
