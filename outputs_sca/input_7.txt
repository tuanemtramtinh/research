The flow then continues with Step 3 using the filtered or sorted overview.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 4): Laboratory technician chooses to review detailed information of multiple tests before entering any results. Condition: The laboratory technician wishes to plan work by reviewing several test details in sequence. Flow: After viewing the details of one test in Step 4, the laboratory technician returns to the overview and selects another pending laboratory test → System displays the detailed information of the newly selected test. The laboratory technician may repeat this review cycle multiple times, after which the flow continues with Step 5 for the test chosen for result entry.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 6): Laboratory technician saves partially completed test result data as a draft. Condition: The laboratory technician cannot complete all test measurements at once but wants to preserve entered information. Flow: Instead of final confirmation, the laboratory technician chooses to save the current entry as an intermediate state → System validates the provided partial data to the extent possible, stores it as a draft linked to the laboratory test, and keeps the test in a state where it still appears in the list of tests that need to be completed. The flow may later resume at Step 5 or Step 6 when the laboratory technician is ready to finalize the results.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 8): New laboratory test requests arrive while the laboratory technician is viewing the overview. Condition: Additional tests are requested by doctors during the ongoing session. Flow: While the laboratory technician is in the laboratory test management workspace, new test requests are recorded by the system → System generates one or more notifications according to configured rules and offers an option to refresh the overview list; when the laboratory technician refreshes or acknowledges, the system updates the overview in Step 2 to include the newly requested tests, and the flow proceeds with Step 3."

The use case terminates for the current attempt; the laboratory technician may retry starting from the triggering event once the issue is resolved.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 4): Selected laboratory test is no longer available or accessible. Condition: The laboratory technician selects a test that has just been completed, cancelled, or is otherwise no longer accessible. Flow: Laboratory technician selects the test → System detects that the selected laboratory test is not in a valid state for processing and does not display the details; instead, it shows an explanatory message and refreshes the overview to reflect the current set of pending tests. The flow resumes at Step 3 with the updated overview.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 6): Entered laboratory test results fail validation. Condition: The laboratory technician enters results that violate data consistency rules (for example, missing required fields or values outside allowed formats). Flow: Laboratory technician confirms the entry → System validates the entered results, detects validation errors, does not store the invalid data as final results, and displays clear error messages indicating which fields require correction while preserving the entered values where possible. The flow returns to Step 6 for corrected data entry.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 8): Notification mechanism for new laboratory test requests fails. Condition: The system cannot generate or deliver notifications for new test requests due to an internal error. Flow: New test requests are recorded while the laboratory technician is in the management workspace → System fails to send or display the configured notifications and logs the error; the laboratory technician can still obtain the updated list of pending tests by reloading the overview manually in Step 2. The use case continues without automated notifications but the technician may experience delayed awareness of incoming tests."
