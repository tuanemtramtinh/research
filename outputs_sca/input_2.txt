=== USE CASES ===
[1] View Real-Time Traffic (actors: umd employee)
  description: UMD employees view real-time traffic, maps, and environmental conditions on an interactive city map for situational awareness.
  - As a UMD employee, I want to see a real-time simulation of the current traffic situation of Wonderland, so that I can take more informed decisions
  - As a UMD employee, I want to have an up-to-date map of the streets of Wonderland (including different road types and obstacles), so that I have an accurate background for the traffic simulator.
  - As a UMD employee, I want to see the current traffic on the map (gathered from the sensors in Wonderland), so that I can monitor the current situation including busy areas and congestions
[2] Analyze and Predict Traffic (actors: umd employee)
  description: UMD employees analyze historical traffic and environmental data to generate predictions, compare scenarios, and assess expected impacts.
  - As a UMD employee, I want to be able to make predictions about future traffic situations based on similar situations in the past, so that I can take more informed decisions
  - As a UMD employee, I want to know when an area is expected to be too crowded, so that i can work on a solution to avoid the problem
  - As a UMD employee, I want to be able to compare historical traffic data, so that I can use the data to create meaningful analyses
[3] Manage Traffic Data (actors: umd employee)
  description: UMD employees collect, enrich, and store sensor, simulator, and environmental data over time for later analysis and visualization.
  - As a UMD employee, I want to add new sensor measurements to the map when they become available, so that my simulator is as accurate as possible
  - As a UMD employee, I want to save all historical data, so that I am able to create meaningful insights about this data at a later moment.
  - As a UMD employee, I want to save the simulator data (map, traffic and heatmap) of every moment coupled to that specific time, so that I can look into them at a later moment
[4] Access Simulation Platform (actors: umd employee)
  description: UMD employees access and operate the traffic simulation platform reliably, remotely, and across devices using an intuitive interface.
  - As a UMD employee, I want to use an intuitive system, so that I can quickly understand all the functions in the system.
  - As a UMD employee, I want to use new data sources as they become available, so that my simulator is as accurate as possible.As a UMD employee, I want the system to always be available, so that I can access it whenever I need
  - As a UMD employee, I want to be able to access the system 24/7, so that I can work flexible shifts
