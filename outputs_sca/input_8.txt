Condition: The system cannot store the submitted event because of a transient storage or network issue → System informs the match official that the submission failed, preserves the event details locally within the session where possible, allows the match official to retry submission, and if repeated attempts fail, logs the failure and ends the use case for that event without storing it.",

Condition: The fan is not allowed to view live game event reports for the selected match or there is a failure retrieving data → System denies access or shows an error message indicating that live game event reports cannot be displayed at this time, does not present any event data, and the fan’s interaction ends for this use case instance.",
