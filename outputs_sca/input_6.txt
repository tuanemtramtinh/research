If the referee cancels, the failed event is not stored and the flow continues with Step 6 for subsequent events; if repeated failures occur and the referee cannot proceed, the referee may terminate the session, and the use case ends with only previously saved events available.",

System displays an error message indicating that event recording cannot be started and logs the failure for administrative review. The use case ends without recording any game events.",

Condition: When the referee indicates that the game has ended, the system encounters an error while finalizing the event data set.
