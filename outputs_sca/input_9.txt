    "2. Actor initiates a search or selection of a patient record (e.g., by choosing own record, a known patient, or an associated child) → System validates the actor’s access rights and displays the patient search interface or directly selects the relevant patient record according to the actor’s role.",
    "3. Actor enters search criteria or selects from an allowed patient list (for example, receptionist enters identifying data, doctor selects from own patients, nurse selects assigned patient, patient selects self or underage child) → System retrieves matching patient records from the Electronic Medical Record Database within the scope of the actor’s permissions and presents the selectable results.",
    "4. Actor selects a specific patient record from the presented list or direct selection → System fetches the full patient record that the actor is authorized to access and displays demographic and medical information in a structured view.",
    "5. Actor reviews the displayed patient demographic information and medical record details (such as medical history, treatments, and test results) as permitted by their role → System maintains a read-only view for any data elements for which the actor does not have edit rights and ensures that confidential sections remain hidden if not authorized.",
    "6. Actor decides to update allowed information in the patient record, such as demographic data by a receptionist or uhope employee, medical data by a doctor, or address data by a patient in their personal account → System presents editable fields only for data elements the actor is authorized to modify and indicates which data are non-editable.",
    "7. Actor enters or modifies the patient information in the provided editable fields, ensuring that data is entered once in the Electronic Medical Record Database interface → System validates the entered data for completeness and format and shows any validation messages that must be resolved before saving.",
    "8. Actor confirms the changes to the patient record and submits the update request → System applies the validated changes to the corresponding patient record in the Electronic Medical Record Database, overwriting the previous values for those fields while preserving other data.",
    "9. System records that the patient record has been viewed or updated, including actor identity and timestamp according to configured logging rules → System refreshes the displayed patient record with the updated information and shows a confirmation that the record has been successfully saved.",
    "10. Actor optionally continues to view additional sections of the patient record or closes the patient record management interface → System closes the patient record view on request and returns the actor to the general dashboard or home screen while keeping the updated patient information available for subsequent authorized access."
  ],
  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF-1 (from Step 2): Patient accesses own record directly – Condition: The actor is a patient who has successfully logged into their personal account and selects to view their own medical record. The system, instead of displaying a general search interface, directly selects the patient’s own record, applies access checks for self-access, and proceeds as if Step 4 has been completed. The flow then continues at Step 4.",
    "AF-2 (from Step 2): Patient accesses underage child’s medical file – Condition: The actor is a patient who has logged into their personal account and chooses to view an underage child’s medical file from a list of associated children. The system verifies guardian access rights for the selected child, retrieves the child’s record if permitted, and proceeds to show the record as in Step 4, after which the flow continues at Step 4.",
    "AF-3 (from Step 3): Doctor selects from own patient list without entering free-text search – Condition: The actor is a doctor who chooses to navigate via a list of their own patients instead of entering explicit search criteria. The system retrieves and displays only those patients assigned to that doctor, the doctor selects a patient, and the flow then continues at Step 4.",
    "AF-4 (from Step 3): Nurse selects patient assigned for current task – Condition: The actor is a nurse accessing the system on a mobile device and selects a patient from a list of patients assigned to the nurse. The system restricts the list according to task assignment, the nurse selects a patient, and the flow continues at Step 4.",
    "AF-5 (from Step 6): Actor performs view-only access – Condition: The actor intends only to review patient information and does not choose to modify any fields. The system keeps all fields in read-only mode, no edit operation is initiated, and after completing review the actor closes the record, causing the flow to proceed directly to Step 10 without executing Steps 7 and 8.",
    "AF-6 (from Step 6): Patient updates address only – Condition: The actor is a patient using their personal account and chooses to update only the address information. The system shows editable address fields while leaving all other fields read-only, the patient updates and submits the new address, the system validates and saves the address change as in Steps 7 and 8, and the flow then continues at Step 9.",
    "AF-7 (from Step 3): Receptionist finds a single unique match – Condition: The receptionist enters search criteria that uniquely identify a single patient. The system automatically opens that patient’s record without presenting a list, and the flow continues at Step 4."

  "exception_flows": [
    "EF-1 (from Step 2): Actor not authorized to access patient record management – Condition: The actor attempts to open the patient record management functionality but does not have sufficient access rights. The system denies access, displays an authorization error message, logs the attempt according to security policy, and terminates the use case without exposing any patient data.",
    "EF-2 (from Step 3): No matching patient records found – Condition: The actor enters search criteria that do not match any patient in the Electronic Medical Record Database. The system displays a message indicating that no records were found, allows the actor to revise the search criteria or cancel the operation, and the flow either returns to Step 3 upon new input or terminates the use case if the actor cancels.",
    "EF-3 (from Step 3): Actor attempts to access a patient outside permitted scope – Condition: The system identifies that a selected or matched patient record is outside the actor’s allowed scope (for example, a doctor selects a patient who is not assigned to that doctor). The system blocks access to that record, displays an appropriate error message, logs the denied access attempt, and returns the actor to the patient selection step at Step 3.",
    "EF-4 (from Step 7): Data validation failure on update – Condition: The actor enters new or updated data that fails system validation rules (for example, required fields missing or invalid format). The system rejects the attempted save, highlights the invalid fields, shows validation messages, and returns the flow to Step 7 to allow the actor to correct the input or cancel the changes.",
    "EF-5 (from Step 8): Database update error – Condition: A technical error occurs while saving the updated patient record to the Electronic Medical Record Database. The system does not commit any partial changes, displays an error notification to the actor indicating that the save operation failed, logs the technical error for further investigation, and ends the use case with the patient record remaining in its previous consistent state.",
    "EF-6 (from Step 2): Session expired before record access – Condition: The actor’s authenticated session expires before or during the attempt to access the patient record management interface. The system invalidates the session, redirects the actor to the login interface, informs the actor that the session has expired, and terminates the current instance of the use case without displaying any patient data."

The system restricts the list according to task assignment, the nurse selects a patient, and the flow continues at Step 4.",

The system rejects the attempted save, highlights the invalid fields, shows validation messages, and returns the flow to Step 7 to allow the actor to correct the input or cancel the changes.",
      "EF-5 (from Step 8): Database update error – Condition: A technical error occurs while saving the updated patient record to the Electronic Medical Record Database. The system does not commit any partial changes, displays an error notification to the actor indicating that the save operation failed, logs the technical error for further investigation, and ends the use case with the patient record remaining in its previous consistent state.",
