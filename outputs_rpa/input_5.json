time reentering the same information.\nAs a depositor, I want to link to data stored in external repositories, so that I can store my data in an appropriate repository but still register it with the

data from Bath collaborators off campus, so that I can collaborate effectively.\nAs a research facility manager, I want to deposit data from my facility directly into the archive on behalf of researchers, so that I am no longer required to maintain my own archive of facility data and researchers can access their own data as needed. \nAs a Bath Data Archive administrator, I want to make

checked.\nAs a Bath Data Archive administrator, I want to require a minimum set of metadata, so that consistent quality of metadata is maintained.\nAs a Bath Data Archive administrator, I want to approve scheduled disposal of data, so that data which is still required is not destroyed.\nAs a Bath Data Archive administrator, I want to query the entire archive , so that I can report on particular aspects of the archive holdings.\nAs a Bath Data Archive administrator, I want to import Bath data from an external data centre wholesale, so that Bath data holdings in external archives are not lost if they close down.\nAs a Bath Data Archive administrator, I want to encourage and promote the use of open standards for deposit, so that data is as reusable as possible.\nAs a Research Information manager, I want to integrate the archive with CRIS, so that I can analyse impact of research data publication I can link funding to all of the outputs it produces.\nAs a Research Information manager, I want to include records for externally held data complete, so that the university's record of data holdings is complete.\nAs a Research Information manager, I want to track citation counts for published datasets, so that impact of datasets within academia can be demonstrated.\nAs a Research Information manager, I want to segment the view and download statistics by country and sector so that impact of datasets outside academia can be demonstrated.\nAs a Research Information manager, I want to have datasets linked to metadata about projects, so that I can report on projects depositing datasets in relation to funder requirements.\nAs an UnivITservice, I want to store archived data on existing storage systems, so that university data storage is consistent and maintainable and future availability of data can be guaranteed.\nAs an UnivITservice, I want to integrate the archive with existing university systems such as LDAP, so that the cost of administering the system can be kept low.\nAs an UnivITservice, I want to store archived data directly on the HCP object store, so that  features can be made.\nAs an UnivITservice, I want to be able to export all data to a different system, so that I am not tied into one system which may not be the most appropriate at some point in the future.\nAs a developer, I want to deposit and maintain datasets via an API such as SWORD2, so that my service can interact with the archive. \nAs an academicpublisher, I want to make persistent web links between my articles and underlying datasets, so that my journals can be seen to be filled with robust, high quality research. \nAs a fundingbody, I want to be reassured that researchers I fund have robust archival plans for their data, so that I can be sure that funding them is a worthwhile investment.\nAs a fundingbody, I want to harvest metadata on outputs from research I fund, so that I can analyse effectiveness of funding strategy and I can encourage cross fertilisation of research outputs.",
