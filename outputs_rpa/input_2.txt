=== USE CASES ===
[1] View Traffic Maps (actors: umd employee)
  User stories:
    - As a UMD employee, I want to see a real-time simulation of the current traffic situation of Wonderland so that I can take more informed decisions.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to have an up-to-date map of the streets of Wonderland, including different road types and obstacles, so that I have an accurate background for the traffic simulator.

[2] View Environmental Data (actors: umd employee)
  User stories:
    - As a UMD employee, I want to see environmental measures taken at points in the city in real time on the map so that I know how the current traffic situation is affecting the environment.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to see the overall real-time CO2 emissions so that I know how harmful the traffic situation is to the environment.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to see the real-time level of noise per measurement point on the map so that I can see if the noise levels exceed the legal limits.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to see the real-time overall level of air pollution so that I know how harmful the traffic situation is to the environment.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to see the real-time levels of air pollution per measurement point on the map so that I can see when a certain area is getting too polluted.

[3] Predict Traffic Impact (actors: umd employee)
  User stories:
    - As a UMD employee, I want to be able to make predictions about future traffic situations based on similar situations in the past so that I can take more informed decisions.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to know when an area is expected to be too crowded so that I can work on a solution to avoid the problem.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to make predictions about the consequences of changing the urban planning of Wonderland so that I can rely on data when making a decision.

[6] Store Historical Data (actors: umd employee)
  User stories:
    - As a UMD employee, I want all historical data to be saved so that I am able to create meaningful insights about this data at a later moment.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to save the simulator data, including the map, traffic, and heat map, of every moment coupled to that specific time so that I can look into it at a later moment.
    - As a UMD employee, I want to save the environmental measures of every moment coupled to that specific time so that I can look into them at a later moment.
