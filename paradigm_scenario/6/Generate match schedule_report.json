    "1. **Alternative 1 – Manual Override (Step 7)** 1.1 IFA selects a conflicting fixture. 1.2 IFA manually reassigns a referee or reschedules the match. 1.3 System verifies the change against constraints and updates the schedule.",
    "2. **Alternative 2 – Partial Schedule Generation (Step 4)** 2.1 System detects incomplete data (e.g., missing venue). 2.2 System generates a provisional schedule for available matches. 2.3 IFA receives a “partial schedule” notification and completes missing data later."

  "exception_flows": [
    "- System cannot persist the final schedule. - System rolls back to the previous stable state and alerts IFA."
