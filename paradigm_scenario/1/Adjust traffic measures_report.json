  "context_of_use": "The IT system must provide urban mobility planners with a dynamic simulation platform that: 1. Models traffic congestion under various scenarios. 2. Allows real‑time adjustment of speed limits, reversible lane directions, roundabouts, adaptive traffic lights, road closures, and event‑induced traffic surges. 3. Supplies predictive analytics on congestion, emissions, noise, and neighborhood impact. 4. Triggers alerts when a measure creates congestion or inequity. 5. Incorporates historical sensor data for scenario analysis. 6. Estimates financial costs and environmental impacts. 7. Supports crisis simulation for emergency services. 8. Generates customizable reports (executive summaries, detailed analyses, fairness, cost, emission, and congestion metrics). 9. Offers a recommendation engine for congestion‑mitigation solutions.",
