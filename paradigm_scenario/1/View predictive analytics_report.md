## Use Case Report: View predictive analytics

**1. Use Case Name**  
View predictive analytics  

**2. Description**  
Provide predictive analytics on congestion, emissions, noise, and neighborhood impact for planned scenarios.  

**3. Primary Actor**  
Urban Mobility Planner  

**4. Problem Domain Context**  
The IT system must provide urban mobility planners with a dynamic simulation platform that  

1. models traffic congestion under various scenarios,  
2. allows real‑time adjustment of speed limits, reversible lane directions, roundabouts, adaptive traffic lights, road closures, and event‑induced traffic surges,  
3. supplies predictive analytics on congestion, emissions, noise, and neighborhood impact,  
4. triggers alerts when a measure creates congestion or inequity,  
5. incorporates historical sensor data for scenario analysis,  
6. estimates financial costs and environmental impacts,  
7. supports crisis simulation for emergency services,  
8. generates customizable reports (executive summaries, detailed analyses, fairness, cost, emission, and congestion metrics), and  
9. offers a recommendation engine for congestion‑mitigation solutions.  

**5. Preconditions**  
- The Urban Mobility Planner has selected a scenario (or created a new one).  
- The simulation engine has successfully initialized for the selected scenario.  
- Historical sensor data and real‑time traffic feeds are available and authenticated.  

**6. Postconditions**  
- A comprehensive set of predictive analytics (congestion, emissions, noise, neighborhood impact) is displayed to the planner.  
- The analytics are stored in the system’s report repository for future reference.  
- Any alerts generated by the analytics are logged and optionally forwarded to relevant stakeholders.  

**7. Main Flow**  

1. **Planner initiates analytics** – The Urban Mobility Planner selects the “View Predictive Analytics” option from the scenario dashboard.  
2. **System validates scenario** – The system checks that the scenario is fully configured (route network, traffic demand, control settings).  
3. **Request data** – The system retrieves historical sensor data, real‑time traffic feeds, and any user-defined parameters.  
4. **Run simulation** – The simulation engine processes the scenario, applying current controls and projecting traffic conditions.  
5. **Generate analytics** – Post‑processing modules calculate:  
   - Congestion indices (e.g., average delay, queue length).  
   - Emission estimates (CO₂, NOₓ, particulate matter).  
   - Noise levels (dB).  
   - Neighborhood impact metrics (accessibility, equity scores).  
6. **Render dashboard** – The analytics are visualized on interactive charts, heat maps, and summary tables.  
7. **Store results** – The system archives the analytics in the scenario’s report repository.  
8. **Notify planner** – The planner receives a completion notification and can proceed to review or export the data.  

**8. Alternative Flows**  

- **A1 (Scenario incomplete)** – *Trigger:* Step 2  
  1. The system detects missing configuration data.  
  2. It presents a prompt to the planner highlighting the missing elements.  
  3. The planner completes the configuration and re‑initiates the analytics.  

- **A2 (No data available)** – *Trigger:* Step 3  
  1. The system finds no historical or real‑time data for the selected period.  
  2. It offers to use a default data set or to skip analytics generation.  
  3. If the planner chooses to proceed, the system uses the default dataset.  

- **A3 (User requests partial analytics)** – *Trigger:* Step 6  
  1. The planner selects specific metrics (e.g., only emissions).  
  2. The system adjusts the rendering to display only the requested metrics.  

**9. Exceptions**  

- **E1 (Simulation engine failure)** – *Trigger:* Step 4  
  1. The system logs the error and displays a user‑friendly message.  
  2. It offers to retry or to report the issue to support.  

- **E2 (Data retrieval timeout)** – *Trigger:* Step 3  
  1. The system attempts a second retrieval after a brief wait.  
  2. If the timeout persists, it notifies the planner and aborts the analytics.  

- **E3 (Analytics calculation error)** – *Trigger:* Step 5  
  1. The system captures the exception stack trace.  
  2. It logs the error, alerts the support team, and presents a fallback message to the planner.  

- **E4 (Storage write failure)** – *Trigger:* Step 7  
  1. The system attempts to retry the write operation.  
  2. If it fails again, it prompts the planner to retry manually or to choose a different storage location.
