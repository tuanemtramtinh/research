  "main_flow": [
    "1. **Actor initiates action** – The Urban Mobility Planner selects the *Generate customizable reports* option from the dashboard.",
    "2. **System prompts for report type** – The system displays a modal with available report categories (executive summary, detailed analysis, fairness, cost, emission, congestion metrics).",
    "3. **Actor selects desired categories** – The planner checks the boxes for the categories they wish to include.",
    "4. **System prompts for filters** – The system asks for time range, geographic area, scenario ID, and any custom parameters (e.g., specific road segments).",
    "5. **Actor inputs filters** – The planner enters or selects the required filter values.",
    "6. **System validates inputs** – The system checks that all required fields are populated and that the filters are consistent.",
    "7. **System aggregates data** – The system queries historical sensor data, simulation results, and cost/impact models to compile the requested metrics.",
    "8. **System generates report sections** – For each selected category, the system creates the corresponding report section using predefined templates.",
    "9. **System compiles full report** – All sections are assembled into a single document (PDF/HTML).",
    "10. **System displays preview** – The planner can preview the report in a viewer.",
    "11. **Actor reviews and customizes** – The planner can edit titles, add executive commentary, or adjust visualizations.",
    "12. **Actor finalizes report** – The planner clicks *Generate* to produce the final version.",
    "13. **System saves report** – The report is stored in the repository with metadata (author, creation time, filters used).",
    "14. **System offers export/share options** – The planner can email, download, or share the report via collaborative platform.",
    "15. **Use case completes** – The system returns to the dashboard."

  "alternative_flows": [
    "AF1 (Missing filter values) [Trigger: Step 4 or 5]: The system detects incomplete filters, displays an error message, and prompts the actor to complete the missing fields before proceeding.",
    "AF2 (No data available for selected criteria) [Trigger: Step 7]: The system informs the actor that no records match the filters and offers to broaden the criteria or cancel the report generation.",
    "AF3 (Actor cancels before finalization) [Trigger: Step 11 or 12]: The planner clicks *Cancel*; the system discards any unsaved changes and returns to the dashboard."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "E1 (Data source failure during aggregation (Step 7)): The system logs the error, displays a notification to the actor indicating that the report could not be generated due to a backend issue, and offers to retry.",
    "E2 (Report generation timeout (Step 9)): If the compilation exceeds the allowed time, the system aborts the process, informs the actor, and suggests reducing the scope or filters.",
    "E3 (Permission denied when saving report (Step 13)): The system alerts the actor that they lack write access to the repository, prompts for an alternative directory, or requests elevated permissions.",
    "E4 (Export format unsupported (Step 14)): If the actor selects an unsupported export format, the system notifies them and provides a list of supported formats."
