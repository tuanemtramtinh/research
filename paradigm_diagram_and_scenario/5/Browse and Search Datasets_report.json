    "1. **Actor initiates action.** The Reuser opens the web portal and navigates to the *Browse & Search* section.",

    "3. **Actor enters search criteria.** The Reuser types keywords, selects filters, and clicks *Search*.",
    "4. **System queries catalogue.** The backend performs a full‑text and metadata query across all integrated repositories, aggregating results.",
    "5. **System returns results list.** Search results are paginated, each entry showing title, owner, abstract, language, version count, and citation metrics.",
    "6. **Actor selects a dataset.** The Reuser clicks on a dataset title to view its landing page.",
    "7. **System displays dataset landing page.** The page shows metadata (title, authors, institution, DOI, license, embargo dates), a preview pane (table of contents, sample files), and version history.",
    "8. **Actor requests preview.** The Reuser clicks *Preview* on a specific file.",
    "9. **System streams preview.** The file is rendered in‑browser (PDF, CSV, image) or a download link is provided.",
    "10. **Actor compares versions.** The Reuser selects *Compare Versions* from the version history menu.",
    "11. **System presents version comparison.** A side‑by‑side diff of metadata and file changes is shown.",
    "12. **Actor retrieves citation.** The Reuser clicks *Cite Dataset* to view citation options (APA, MLA, Chicago, RIS).",
    "13. **System generates citation.** The portal displays the formatted citation and offers a copy button.",
    "14. **Actor copies or exports citation.** The Reuser copies the citation to clipboard or downloads a citation file (BibTeX, EndNote).",
    "15. **System logs interaction.** Analytics capture the search query, dataset views, previews, and citation exports for reporting."

  "exception_flows": [
    "1. **Search query returns no results.** The system displays a friendly message: “No datasets found for your criteria. Try adjusting filters or keywords.”",
    "2. **Metadata retrieval fails for a dataset.** The system shows a placeholder with “Metadata currently unavailable. Please try again later.” and logs the error for administrators.",
    "3. **Preview file is not supported.** The system informs the Reuser: “This file type cannot be previewed. Download it directly.”",
    "4. **License or embargo prevents access.** The system displays the embargo date and license restrictions, offering an *Request Access* button if the Reuser has the necessary privileges.",
    "5. **Network or server error during search.** The system shows “An error occurred while processing your request. Please refresh the page or try again later.” and records the exception."
