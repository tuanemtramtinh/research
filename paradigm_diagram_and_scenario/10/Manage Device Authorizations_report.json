System rejects the change and displays a conflict explanation. 3. Administrator must resolve the conflict before proceeding.",
    "- **AF3 – Notification Failure (Step 10)** 1. System fails to send notification due to network issue. 2. System logs the failure and flags the notification for retry. 3. Administrator receives a system alert regarding the pending notification."

    "- **E4 – Audit Log Failure (Step 9)** 1. System fails to record the audit entry. 2. System alerts administrators and stores the log entry for later reconciliation.",
    "- **E5 – Notification Service Down (Step 10)** 1. System cannot send emails/SMS. 2. System queues the notification for later delivery and logs the failure."
