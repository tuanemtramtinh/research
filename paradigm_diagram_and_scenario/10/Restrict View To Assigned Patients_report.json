  "alternative_flows": [
    "1. **(Flow 5.1)** - If the doctor selects “Cancel” instead of confirming at step 6, the system aborts the restriction process and returns to the dashboard without changing visibility.",
    "2. **(Flow 5.2)** - If the doctor already has a restriction in place and attempts to apply it again, the system displays a message: “Restriction already active.” and offers to remove the restriction instead."
  ],
  "exception_flows": [
    "1. **(Step 2)** - *Authentication Failure*: If the system fails to authenticate the doctor (e.g., wrong credentials, account locked), it displays an error message and terminates the session.",
    "2. **(Step 8)** - *Database Update Failure*: If the system cannot update visibility settings due to a database error, it rolls back any partial changes, displays an error message, and logs the incident for support.",
    "3. **(Step 10)** - *Audit Trail Failure*: If recording the action fails, the system still applies the restriction but flags the incident for later manual audit and notifies the system administrator."
