  "context_of_use": "Develop an integrated patient‑care platform that: 1. Provides patients with secure mobile access to their full medical record, including measurements, test results, and prescription renewal. 2. Enables patients to share wearable‑device data and selectively grant or revoke access to healthcare providers. 3. Allows doctors to view, edit, annotate patient records, schedule appointments, request and track laboratory tests, and issue prescriptions while managing pharmacy inventory visibility. 4. Permits nurses to edit and review records for clinical preparation. 5. Supports receptionists with patient identification, appointment scheduling, and room assignment using doctor and lab availability. 6. Equips laboratory technicians with a dashboard of pending tests, urgency, and requester details, along with the ability to input results and attach notes. 7. Offers pharmacists the ability to verify patient ID, dosage, and prescription details. 8. Gives system administrators the capability to configure user roles, enforce two‑step authentication, and adjust access rights across the system.",

    "- **Alternative Flow A2 (Role-Based Assignment)**",
    "1. *Administrator* chooses to assign a predefined role (e.g., *Doctor*, *Nurse*, *Lab Technician*). 2. The system automatically applies the role’s default permissions to the user.",
