    "6. Administrator **fills in league details** and submits the form.",
    "7. System **validates input** against business rules (unique name, budget limits).",

    "10. System presents a form for team details (name, coach, budget, roster, etc.).",
    "11. Administrator **fills in team details** and submits.",

    "3. *Alternative to Step 15* 3.1. If a scheduling conflict is detected, system **provides conflict details** and suggests alternative dates or venues.",

  "exception_flows": [
    "1. **Authentication Failure** (Step 1) *System logs the attempt, displays an error, and terminates the session.*",
    "2. **Database Connectivity Loss** (any step involving data persistence) *System rolls back the transaction, alerts the administrator, and queues the operation for retry.*",
    "3. **Budget Exceeded** (Step 12 or 15) *System aborts the current operation, shows a detailed budget violation message, and requires administrator intervention.*",
    "4. **Schedule Conflict** (Step 15) *System aborts scheduling, presents conflict details, and allows the administrator to resolve the issue.*",
    "5. **Notification Failure** (Step 18) *System logs the failure, retries after a configurable interval, and notifies the administrator if the notification remains unsent after N attempts.*"
