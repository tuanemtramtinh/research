  "context_of_use": "The IT system must provide urban mobility planners with a dynamic simulation platform that: 1. Models traffic congestion under various scenarios. 2. Allows real‑time adjustment of speed limits, reversible lane directions, roundabouts, adaptive traffic lights, road closures, and event‑induced traffic surges. 3. Supplies predictive analytics on congestion, emissions, noise, and neighborhood impact. 4. **Triggers alerts when a measure creates congestion or inequity.** 5. Incorporates historical sensor data for scenario analysis. 6. Estimates financial costs and environmental impacts. 7. Supports crisis simulation for emergency services. 8. Generates customizable reports (executive summaries, detailed analyses, fairness, cost, emission, and congestion metrics). 9. Offers a recommendation engine for congestion‑mitigation solutions.",

    "- The simulation platform is running and connected to real‑time traffic data feeds. - The Urban Mobility Planner has logged into the system and has appropriate permissions. - All relevant measures (e.g., new speed limits, lane reversals) have been input into the system."

  "postconditions": [
    "- The system displays an alert indicator for any measure that results in congestion or inequity. - Alert details (measure, affected corridor, predicted congestion level, inequity metrics) are logged in the system audit trail. - The Urban Mobility Planner can view and act on the alert through the interface."
