' Define primary actors (outside system boundary)
actor "System Admin" as SA
actor "Regular User" as RU
actor "Traffic Analyst" as TA

' Define system and use cases

  ' Base use cases (light blue)
  usecase "Ingest Sensor Data" as UC1 #ADD8E6
  usecase "Display Traffic and Environmental Heat Maps" as UC2 #ADD8E6
  usecase "Run Predictive Modeling" as UC3 #ADD8E6

  ' New use cases for includes / extends (light grey)
  usecase "Store Simulation State" as UC4 #EAEAEA
  usecase "Compare Data Points" as UC5 #EAEAEA
}

' Actor – use case relationships
SA -- UC1
RU -- UC2
TA -- UC3

' Include/extend relationships (inside the rectangle)
UC1 <.. UC4 : "<<includes>>"   ' Data ingestion automatically stores state
UC3 ..> UC5 : "<<extends>>"    ' Predictive modeling can be extended with side‑by‑side comparison

' Note: UC4 and UC5 are not directly tied to any actor, they are internal system operations
