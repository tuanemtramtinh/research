  "context_of_use": "The system must: 1. Enable doctors to create, view, and electronically transfer prescriptions to pharmacies. 2. Allow patients to view, edit personal information, and request new prescriptions through online or mobile appointment scheduling. 3. Provide nurses, receptionists, and doctors with secure access to patients’ electronic medical records, including medical history, personal details, and notes. 4. Support mobile device synchronization for doctors and patients to maintain consistent workflow across platforms. 5. Allow pharmacists to view transferred prescriptions and manage medication dispensing. 6. Grant system administrators the ability to centrally store all data, integrate electronic medical records, enforce GDPR and privacy controls, and manage user access levels. 7. Supply systems analysts with anonymized clinical data, bed occupancy, room scheduling, and employee schedules for analytics. 8. Record appointment start and end times for duration calculations. 9. Support migration of data from legacy systems to the new platform. 10. Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict system component access to authorized users.",
