    "EF-6 (from Steps 6 or 7): If network connectivity between the referee’s mobile device and the system is lost while reporting events, the system notifies the referee of the connectivity issue and queues locally captured events if possible; events are transmitted when connectivity is restored, or if connectivity is not restored before the referee ends the session, the system instructs the referee that queued events could not be synchronized and the use case ends with some events potentially missing from the central system.",
    "EF-7 (from Step 8): If the system cannot generate or update the automatic match data report due to a processing error, the system informs the referee that the report is currently unavailable, logs the error, and maintains previously stored events; the use case may continue with additional event reporting but completes without providing an updated report."
