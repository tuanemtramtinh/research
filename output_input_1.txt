=== USE CASES ===
[1] Generate Solution Reports (actors: urban mobility planner)
  description: Create and present executive summaries and detailed reports describing the consequences of proposed mobility solutions.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to report an executive summary of a solution, so that I can inform the mayor of the consequences of a proposal.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to make an extensive report on a solution, so that I can inform the consultancy company of the consequences of a proposal.
[2] Configure Traffic Measures (actors: urban mobility planner)
  description: Set up and modify traffic control measures such as speed limits, lane directions, reversible lanes, roundabouts, adaptive traffic lights, road closures, and traffic crisis scenarios.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to adjust speed limits so that I can review the effects of the measure.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to revertible lanes switch directions of so that I can review the effects of the measure.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to model roundabouts so that I can review the effects of the measure.
[3] Estimate Measure Impacts (actors: urban mobility planner)
  description: Calculate and review cost, emissions, noise levels, and sensor-based traffic metrics for proposed mobility measures or events.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to get an estimation of the cost of a measure so that I can review the financial consequences of the measure.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to know the estimated emission of a congestion, so that I can review the pollution effects of a measure or event.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to know the estimated noise levels of traffic situations, so that I can review the environmental effects of a measure or event.
[4] Report Measure Impacts (actors: urban mobility planner)
  description: Produce reports on the pollution, fairness, cost, and congestion effects of a mobility measure to support proposal validation.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to report on the pollution effects of a measure, so that I can offer validation for my proposal.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to report on the fairness of a measure, so that I can offer validation for my proposal.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to report on the cost of a measure, so that I can offer validation for my proposal.
[5] Receive Impact Alerts (actors: urban mobility planner)
  description: Get notifications and suggested solutions about congestion and neighborhood impacts resulting from mobility measures.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to be notified if a measure leads to congestion so that I do not overlook the congestion.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to get suggested solutions for a traffic congestion, so that I can be inspired to solve the problem.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to be notified if a measure disadvantages a neighborhood so that fairness can be increased.
[6] View Historical Traffic (actors: urban mobility planner)
  description: Inspect historical traffic situations for past dates to analyze and compare mobility scenarios.
  - As an urban mobility planner, I want to see traffic situations at past dates so that I can analyze traffic scenarios on similar days.
